I swoon at a well-made cheese soufflé, a dish that nobody seems to make anymore. When I was learning to cook, that soufflé seemed like the ultimate challenge, and never was I more proud than when I made my first successful one, puffed high and golden brown, its center still a molten sauce. They are actually quite easy. But they do require the best eggs and cheese (and I wouldn’t scoff at a truffle), and attention when you beat the egg whites, because if you overbeat them they’ll break apart when you fold them into the béchamel with the cheese. Instead of Gruyère alone you can also use a mix of nutty-tasting Gruyère style cheeses; for example, use a mix of Comté (French Gruyère), Beaufort or Fribourg and Gruyère, or substitute Comté for all of the Gruyère.Featured in: An Egg For Every Occasion.Learn: How to Make Soufflé
