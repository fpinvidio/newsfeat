PhotoDonald J. Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, will be among his boss’s delegates to the Republican National Convention, according to a list he provided to the New Hampshire secretary of state.Mr. Lewandowski’s name was on a list of 11 delegates and 11 alternates that the Trump campaign turned over on Feb. 26, which was 17 days after Mr. Trump won the state in a landslide. Mr. Lewandowski also signed the letter to the secretary of state.Mr. Lewandowski is a New Hampshire resident and a former state director for Americans for Prosperity, the group aligned with the industrialists Charles and David Koch. It isn’t unheard-of for campaign officials to become delegates, although Mr. Lewandowski might also have his hands full in his capacity as campaign manager, given the potential for a “stop Trump” effort at the party convention starting July 18 in Cleveland.
