If every baked French fry you've ever eaten has been a soggy disappointment, then this recipe is for you. The key to achieving perfectly crisp “fries” is heating your sheet pan in a 500-degree oven for a good 10 minutes. When you toss the potatoes onto the blisteringly hot pan, magic happens: The potatoes sear and develop a truly crunchy crust. In terms of seasoning, we keep it simple with just salt and pepper, but feel free to experiment with adding a bit of chili or garlic powder, smoked paprika or cayenne to the mix.
