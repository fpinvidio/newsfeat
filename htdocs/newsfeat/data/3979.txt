It started with a call for help.Lisa Marie Velasquez was visiting her relatives in the Melrose housing project when her telephone pinged. A distraught friend said her boyfriend was beating her in an apartment a few miles to the east in the Bronx. Grabbing a bag, Ms. Velasquez left in a rush.Ms. Velasquez, 25, did what many women would do for a friend in an abusive relationship, and like others who intervene to stop domestic violence, her Samaritan’s instinct put her in harm’s way. She ended up being a victim herself.For her, however, going to her friend’s aid was more than just a principled decision. It was deeply personal. As a girl, she had witnessed her mother’s gruesome murder at the hands of a romantic partner, and the trauma had instilled in her a desire to protect others.“She had to leave because her friend was in danger,” Ms. Velasquez’s aunt, Jacqueline Perez, said.In the end, the urge to save her friend led Ms. Velasquez to a fate similar to her mother’s. She walked into the middle of a domestic battle and was bludgeoned to death by her friend’s boyfriend, prosecutors said. The couple is accused of then dismembering her body in a bathtub with a machete and leaving her remains in two parks, wrapped in plastic bags.
