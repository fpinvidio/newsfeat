This is dough to recall the pillowy, golden, butter-crisp pies served at Pizza Hut in the 1990s, a favorite of the chef and pizza consultant Anthony Falco. He gave me his recipe for it in 2018, part of his recipe for pan pizza, but it’s terrific under your favorite pizza sauce and whatever toppings you desire. You might like sausage and peppers, or sausage and anchovies, or plain with extra cheese. But give black olives, provolone and thinly sliced red onion a shot sometime. Plan ahead, though. The recipe may recall corporate delivery pizza dough. But its preparation takes time to proof and to develop flavor. That’s why it’s better.Featured in: The Corporate Delivery Pie You Secretly Love — But Better.
