The hotly anticipated new Han Solo movie — a “Star Wars” spinoff centered on the life of the young space pilot, originally played by Harrison Ford — has lost its two directors.The directing pair, Philip Lord and Christopher Miller, were let go from the production because of artistic differences with the movie studio Lucasfilm.In a statement released on Tuesday, Kathleen Kennedy, the studio’s president, said that the directors were “talented filmmakers who have assembled an incredible cast and crew, but it’s become clear that we had different creative visions on this film, and we’ve decided to part ways.”“A new director will be announced soon,” Ms. Kennedy said.Mr. Lord and Mr. Miller said in the same statement that their “vision and process weren’t aligned with our partners on this product,” adding that the “cliché” of creative differences was in this instance accurate. The two directors, who met in college, have collaborated on “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs” and “The Lego Movie,” both of which they wrote and directed; and “21 Jump Street” and its sequel, “22 Jump Street,” which they directed.
