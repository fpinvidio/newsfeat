Updated, 5:57 p.m. | Using new powers to stifle dissent granted this week by Egypt’s military-backed government, riot police officers dispersed a peaceful protest outside the Parliament in Cairo on Tuesday and detained several prominent activists.Violent arrest of @maisaad & @nazlyhussein two of the most hardworking ppl for detainees & torture victims //t.co/8v58ftBR52″ — Cressida Trew (@dadatrew) 26 Nov 13Video posted online by Mosireen, a collective of activist filmmakers, showed police officers aiming a water cannon directly at protesters chanting against military rule outside the upper house of Parliament, known as the Shura Council. According to video journalists from the independent Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm, the police quickly escalated from spraying water to firing tear gas and roughly detaining protesters, even though the demonstration was almost immediately dispersed.More video of the dispersal, from Egypt’s Revolutionary Socialists, showed that several of the protesters were sitting or kneeling in front of the officers when the water canon was fired at them.بالصور والفيديو..«#بوابة_الشروق» ترصد لحظات القبض على متظاهري مجلس «الشورى»//t.co/TA4nW8DOvo //t.co/lTo3RP36vb” — George Salib® (@G4S90) 26 Nov 13The Egyptian journalist Sharif Kouddous reported that the police attacked protesters as they fled, just one of the ways they apparently exceeded their authority under the new law.Police attack with water then charge at crowd with batons as they flee.
