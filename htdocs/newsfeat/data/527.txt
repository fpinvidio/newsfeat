Advance preparation: You can do this in whatever order is convenient for you. The grains can be cooked ahead and reheated. The vegetables can all be prepared ahead and refrigerated, then reheated before serving. It's best to cook the chicken and mushrooms just before serving so they're nice and hot. But since this is often a way to use leftovers, you can also reheat.
