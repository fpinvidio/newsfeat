Spicy sautéed chard with chiles and ginger is full of flavor, easy and pleasing with pretty much any protein. Here, it moves to the center of the plate with plump, seared shrimp. Any kind of chard can be used for this dish, but rainbow or red will be prettier than white-stemmed Swiss chard. That’s because those stems go right into the pan along with the leaves. It’s not only less wasteful, but the stems also add a pronounced, succulent texture to the mix.Featured in: Sautéed Chard Makes Its Way To Center Stage.
