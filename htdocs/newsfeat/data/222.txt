This drink is sweet, bitter, citrusy and sparkling — even slightly salty — but with minimal punch. It is a graceful way to begin an evening, and a thing of perfection on a sultry afternoon. The spritz can be made several ways, but the best and most common is simply a glass of prosecco with two or three ice cubes and a dash of sparkling water, topped with Aperol, a twist of lemon or slice of orange and — importantly and strangely — one green olive. The drink also can be made with white wine and sparkling water, and Campari or Cynar turn up in some varieties, but the spritz a l’Aperol is the benchmark, and handily trumps the others.Featured in: Case Study | Toasting The Venetian Spritz.
