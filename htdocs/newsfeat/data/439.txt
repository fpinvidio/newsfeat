Tomatoes grow so many places that all herbs seem to have some sort of agreement worked out with them. And the polyamorous tomato seems, among a lucky few ingredients, to carry on genuine and stirring and entirely unique relationships with each herb.Here is a recipe for herbed tomatoes inspired by something my friend Emma made years ago, which she called, enigmatically, Tomatoes Provençal. In any case, mine are neither Provençal nor provincial, but à l’Americaine, using herbs that I usually eat in food from Vietnam and Thailand but that grow happily beside tomatoes in each of those countries — as well as in ours — in what may or may not be a French provincial preparation.Featured in: A Philosophy Of Herbs.
