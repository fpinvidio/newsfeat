Hackers amassed a vast collection of security clearance records, even fingerprints, in a yearlong hacking of the United States Office of Personnel Management. They have breached law firms and accounting firms, and last year they even made off with flight records for millions of United Airlines passengers.It may sound like a crazy collection of unrelated information. But it is not that difficult to make connections among seemingly random bits of information using data-sifting technology.Just as a corporation may use big data to figure out what a consumer might buy based on their past purchases, a spy agency can use big data to make connections to useful intelligence. A Palo Alto, Calif., company named Palantir sells this technology to American intelligence agencies, allowing them, for example, to match travel records and personal data to identify possible terrorists.So while Yahoo’s announcement on Thursday that state-sponsored hackers — the company did not say what country it believes they are working for — had made off with more than 500 million customers’ personal records was stunning to many, intelligence officials say it can be seen as just the latest step in an escalating nation-state digital warfare campaign.“A lot of people overlook why some of these seemingly purposeless breaches matter,” said Mr. Kanuck.Intelligence services could use this information for a range of things — some trivial and some intrusive. They could match international flights taken by their own officials with those taken by American personnel to the same cities at the same time. They could comb the user names and emails released in a hacking of Ashley Madison, the online affairs site that was breached last year, with the personal Yahoo accounts of government officials and contractors or their spouses, and leak that information online or use it for blackmail.And they can use the most intimate details of people’s lives — their medical records — to undercut the reputations of prominent American athletes, as Russian hackers did in a release of medical records stolen from the World Anti-Doping Agency that belonged to the gymnast Simone Biles, the tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams and other Olympic athletes.
