Pierre Franey, that consummate reinterpreter of American cooking, provided this recipe for a Dijon-and-honey spiked coleslaw to The Times in a “60 Minute Gourmet” column in 1990. (It takes much less time to prepare than that.) The result pairs beautifully with any fried seafood and many grilled meats, particularly those scented with soy or curry. It will improve in flavor over the course of a few hours, so it is a good recipe to make in the heat of a weekend day, ahead of an evening barbecue.Featured in: 60 Minute Gourmet.
