A TRIANGULAR BALCONY To maximize a small (78-square-foot) terrace with an odd shape (triangular) on the Upper East Side, Amy Wechsler worked with Kim Hoyt, an architect and landscape architect, to create furniture that fit its tight angles. “I wanted a small oasis with plants and a seating area,” said Dr. Wechsler, 47, a dermatologist who lives in a four-bedroom apartment with her two teenage children. A built-in sofa with integrated side tables allows seating for three. A cube with a reversible top (a cushion on one side and a wood surface on the other) can serve as either a coffee table or an extra seat. Planters that line the perimeter preserve the river view. And a synthetic sisal carpet, typically used on boats, was cut to fit the space and hide the concrete floor. While the upfront investment was substantial (about $18,450), the transformation was worth it, Dr. Wechsler said. Before, the terrace was an “ugly, empty space,” she said, but now, “I spend a lot of time sitting out there.”A CONCRETE PATIO In 2015, Jaylaan Ahmad-Llewellyn moved into a two-bedroom ground-floor duplex in Park Slope, Brooklyn, largely for its private outdoor patio. But at just under 250 square feet and surrounded by 10-foot concrete walls, it was the opposite of inviting. “To be honest, it looked like what I would think a prison exercise pen would look like,” said Ms. Ahmad-Llewellyn, 38, who is completing a master’s degree in clinical psychology after working in the entertainment industry. “It felt like a concrete box.”But Ms. Ahmad-Llewellyn knew it had potential. Another plus: “Having small, elderly dogs who were used to warm weather and outdoor space” — Mo and Lala, Ms. Ahmad-Llewellyn’s 17-year-old miniature Dobermans — “the ability to have a safe place for them to go outside off leash when the weather is bad was a major draw.”
