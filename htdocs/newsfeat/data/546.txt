For an impressive dessert, try these flaky phyllo pastries, which are not at all difficult to make. Form little packages of phyllo leaves brushed with butter, add a smear of sweetened ricotta and top them with ripe figs cut into star shapes. Lightly sugared, baked and drizzled with honey, they are a cross-cultural pleasure, almost like a French tartlet, but with Middle Eastern undertones. Each pastry requires just one sheet of dough. Any remaining leaves can be carefully wrapped and refrozen.Featured in: September Rewards The Fig Lover.
