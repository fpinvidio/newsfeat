She has already been lauded by Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and, of course, Republicans, including her biggest fan, Mr. McConnell.“I’ve heard rumors that should be an outstanding appointment announced later today,” Mr. McConnell said Tuesday, noting that reporters had immediately asked if he planned to recuse himself from voting for his wife. “Let me be quite clear,” he said, “I will not be recusing myself.
