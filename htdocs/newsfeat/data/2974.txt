N OTHING is so satisfying on a piercing winter evening as a down-to-earth steak-and-potatoes dinner. And it can be embellished with minimal effort using a few key ingredients.This recipe calls for a center-cut fillet of beef. Have your butcher trim it well and tie it with twine so it holds its shape while roasting. Mushrooms are abundant now, so you can choose the type you like: chanterelles, morelles, shiitake or a mix of wild mushrooms. The sauce is made by sauteeing the mushrooms in a little of the beef renderings, then adding Madeira, which contributes a lovely sweet essence. Chicken broth, either homemade or a good canned one, is added, along with just a little tomato paste to bind it.My choice of herb is tarragon, which is the foundation for so many great French sauces, although you could experiment with others. The sauce can be made a little ahead and kept warm as the steak cooks.When it comes to mashed potatoes, russets and yellow golds yield the best results. Because of their texture and relatively low water content they make smooth and fluffy, yet substantial and flavorful mashed potatoes. Garlic and onions are personal favorites. I always make mashed potatoes in an old-fashioned food mill or with a hand masher. Food processors, for all their glorious achievements, are too much for this humble dish, often resulting in a gluey, unappetizing mass.
