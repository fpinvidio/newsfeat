The beauty of a diner breakfast is that it's different for everybody, but many consider this the most classic incarnation: eggs, bacon (or sausage) and crisp, salty hash browns. The trick to good hash browns at home: use a very hot, well-seasoned skillet or griddle, since potatoes have a tendency to stick if using stainless steel. Do not worry or fuss over trying to make them too perfect; good hash browns should always look a little unruly – it’s part of their charm. Here, the eggs here are prepared sunnyside up, but over easy, scrambled or poached would be great, too.
