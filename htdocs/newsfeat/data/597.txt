Call this savory mix of wild rice, quinoa, mushrooms, walnuts and greens a stuffing or a pilaf. It’s not meant to go inside a turkey but it's imbued with the definitive flavors of Thanksgiving. Kale or chard add some color; if you’re trying to find a place for greens at the table but don’t want to deal with massive amounts to stem and cook for a crowd, this is a great place for them. The result is substantial, and will satisfy everybody at the table – vegetarians and vegans, and those who avoid gluten. If you're feeding omnivores and wish to add even more flavor, crumble browned Italian sausage into the pan alongside the grains and greens.Featured in: A Savory Alternative To Traditional Stuffing.Learn: How to Make Stuffing
