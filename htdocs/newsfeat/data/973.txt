The police have arrested more protesters for their actions in the huge march on Tuesday in which tens of thousands of people took over the streets of downtown Hong Kong.The Tuesday march, which called for a more direct election of Hong Kong’s chief executive, was one of the largest rallies ever held in the territory. Hong Kong University’s polling unit estimated that more than 150,000 people took part in the rally.One of the people arrested was a man hired to drive a truck that led the demonstrators along the route of the march. He was charged with a traffic ordinance: not turning off the truck’s engine while leaving the vehicle.In a statement issued Wednesday, the police said they were “extremely disappointed” that the truck’s driver refused to comply with police instructions to speed up, thereby slowing the pace of the march. The latest arrests, including that of four other people who were riding in the truck, drew criticism that the police were trying to suppress dissent as the city braces for more disruptive protests while closely-watched electoral reforms are being considered.“The arrest was preposterous and an act of blatant political suppression,” said Icarus Wong, one of the leaders of the protest. “We informed the police of the demonstration in advance and received a letter of no objection. It was completely legal.”“The police are just using every rule it can in the book to arrest protesters,” he said.Besides the driver hired for the truck, two members and two volunteers of the Civil Human Rights Front were also arrested being uncooperative with and obstructing police officers.As the much-anticipated electoral reform is considered, Hong Kong has been experiencing a more tense season of protests, with demonstrators increasingly willing to defy the authorities, and sometimes the laws, to push their political cause.The protests have even reached into the chamber of Hong Kong’s legislature, where a few firebrand legislators have used filibustering tactics to pressure the administration of the territory’s chief executive, Leung Chun-ying. In an rare act of defiance Thursday, some 20 pan-democratic legislators walked out of a question-and-answer session with Mr. Leung to protest what they called his indifference to popular sentiment, chanting, “689, respond to popular opinion.” (Mr. Leung’s critics call him “689” because he won office with just 689 votes among a committee of 1,200 members.)On Wednesday morning, more than 500 protesters were arrested for their overnight sit-in in Central, Hong Kong’s business district. That sit-in, the tail end of Tuesday’s huge protest that began Tuesday in Victoria Park, was seen as a potential precursor to planned “Occupy Central” protests in the coming months.Alex Chow, secretary-general of the Federation of Students, which spearheaded the sit-in, said the student coalition would stage another civil disobedience protest when the government releases its first report on electoral reform, which he expected would be later this month.In an editorial Thursday, the state-run Global Times of China praised the arrests and ​criticized “radical opposition parties” for putting their political ideology above the law.​“​I​f Hong Kong’s rule of law erodes, Hong Kong may fall in the footsteps of Ukraine or Thailand​,” it says.​The Occupy campaign is threatening a large-scale sit-in in Hong Kong’s business district if the government puts forward an electoral reform proposal that doesn’t fulfill what the group calls “international standards” of universal suffrage. Last month, more than 700,000 people voted in a nonbinding referendum commissioned by the group, demanding a say in who can appear on the ballot in the 2017 election.Opponents of the civil disobedience campaign have said that such protests could undermine Hong Kong’s rule of law and tarnish its status as a world financial center.
