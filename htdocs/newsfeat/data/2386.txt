People lined up at the Oldham County Public Library in LaGrange, Ky., in October during an open enrollment for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Proponents of the health care law have held up Kentucky as a model. The state is far ahead of most in signing up people: More than 21,000 have enrolled in Medicaid under an expansion of that program encouraged by the law, and more than 5,000 have signed up for private plans through the state-run exchange, known as Kynect.
