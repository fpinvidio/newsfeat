This vibrant pie is especially tart, due in part to the high quantity of lemon juice, but also due to the fact that it has no meringue. Use fresh squeezed lemon juice for the brightest flavor. Serve it with lightly sweetened whipped cream to temper the tartness, if you like; you could also skip the decorative triangles for a more classic look (in which case you only need to prepare dough for a single crust). You can make and chill the pie up to 1 day ahead, but donâ€™t add the triangles until just before serving. Store leftovers in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap.Featured in: 8 Spectacular Pies That Taste As Good As They Look.
