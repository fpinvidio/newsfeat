This vegan delight came to The New York Times by way of Chloe Coscarelli, the vegan chef and cookbook author. The tender loaf is gently spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger and dotted throughout with dairy-free chocolate chips. Bonus: It's versatile. You can make it in a Bundt pan, a 10-inch loaf pan or in a muffin tin (it makes about 18 muffins). To quote one happy reader: "Delicious! Like my platonic ideal of chocolate-chip banana bread." High praise, indeed.Featured in: Wellâ€™s Vegetarian Thanksgiving 2012.
