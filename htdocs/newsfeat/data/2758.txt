The consequences of that spending are significant, even if it did not result in a hydrogen bomb. As both outside nuclear experts and American intelligence officials have been warning in classified and unclassified briefings for more than a year, North Korea’s small nuclear arsenal seems on the verge of turning into a good-size one. Estimates vary, but many believe that the arsenal could contain more than 20 weapons by the end of this year. Siegfried S. Hecker, the former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the man the North Koreans have periodically allowed into their most secret facilities to convince Washington of their prowess, last year termed that “a hell of a lot of bombs.”Meanwhile, North Korea has improved both the range and mobility of its missiles, making them harder to deter — or to take out if the North Korean regime collapses or decides to go out in a suicidal blaze of glory. Senior American military officials have periodically offered public assessments that the North probably has the ability to make a nuclear weapon small enough to fit atop one of those weapons, meaning the world’s most unpredictable regime could credibly threaten South Korea, Japan, American forces in the Pacific and, eventually, the West Coast of the United States. The only saving grace is that in many missile tests over the past few years, the North Koreans have repeatedly demonstrated pretty lousy aim.
