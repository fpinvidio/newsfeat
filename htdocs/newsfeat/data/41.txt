New York TimesAs promised, we’ll be experimenting with new features this summer, and this is our first: a collaboration with Finding Dulcinea to highlight, and add to, our popular On This Day feature.On This Day is a collection of notable events in history with links to related archival Times articles and lists of both current and historical birthdays for every day of the year. For technical reasons, however, each day’s collection has to exist as a “page” behind the scenes rather than as part of the regular daily flow of blog “posts,” like this one.So, to make each day in history a bigger part of the blog, and to help students see how events in the past still resonate today, we’re creating a new daily post that explores a famous event and connects it to something in the news now.We begin today with Muhammad Ali’s 1967 conviction for violating the United States Selective Service laws by refusing to be drafted.To help us with this project, we’ve enlisted the staff members of Finding Dulcinea, the “Librarian of the Internet.” Their mission is to help students, educators and other Internet users learn how to find authoritative and comprehensive information online.Because Finding Dulcinea has its own popular “On This Day” feature that covers a broad array of intriguing historical events with links to the best online resources to explore those events, we believed that their content complemented Times coverage well.Starting on June 20, staff members from Finding Dulcinea will write a short daily account of what led up each historical event, what happened that day, and what has happened since. They will then provide a brief “Connect to Today” section that looks at parallels of some kind in current news.Let us know what you think! As always, your comments help us shape what we do.Dulcinea Media publishes Finding Dulcinea and maintains SweetSearch, a search engine for students.
