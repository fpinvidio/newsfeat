Ernest Schoedsack and Ruth Rose helped bring King Kong to life on movie screens in 1933. But before they did that, the two — a cinematographer and a writer — fell in love aboard a ship bound for an unconventional scientific expedition. The man who brought them together was William Beebe.Beebe was among the earliest celebrity scientists. From his perch as an ornithologist at the New York Zoological Society (today the Wildlife Conservation Society), he founded the Department of Tropical Research at the turn of the 20th century.Unlike most ecologists of his time, Beebe saw the world beyond science’s narrow lens. He recruited artists, historians, writers and scientists for his expeditions. Together they created awareness about the complex ecosystems primarily in the jungles of South America and the waters of Bermuda and the Galápagos.
