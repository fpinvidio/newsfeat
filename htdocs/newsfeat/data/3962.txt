“Wow, looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over,” Mr. Trump wrote on Friday. “A rigged system!”Two Republican senators said on Thursday that Mr. Comey had begun drafting his statement recommending not to charge Mrs. Clinton before interviewing key aides in the investigation.The president’s message came at the end of a week during which Mr. Trump and his aides have worked to portray the president as singularly focused on the devastating toll of storms pummeling Texas and Louisiana, and to project a more empathetic image for Mr. Trump.Just before posting his complaint about Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump used Twitter to praise the response to the storm, although with a trademark spelling error.
