PhotoLAS VEGAS — Jeb Bush took a break from talking about the principles of economic freedom at a Libre Institute forum here to weigh in on his favorite superhero.In response to a rather specific question from the audience (“Who is your favorite superhero — Marvel, they have in parenthesis — and why?” the moderator asked, reading from an audience notecard), Mr. Bush offered a lighthearted, if slightly circuitous, response.His first answer, appropriately, incorporated the themes of economic prosperity on which Libre, founded by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, is focused: “I like watching the movies, and I wish I owned Marvel, as somebody who believes in capitalism,” Mr. Bush said, to laughter.Then he settled on a superhero. “I’m kind of old school,” he said. “I kind of like the old-school guys, like Batman.” (It should be noted that Batman, while a wonderful savior of Gotham, is actually a DC Comics hero.)And finally, Mr. Bush named another superhero he likes for an entirely different reason.“ ‘Supergirl’ is on TV — I saw that when I was working out this morning,” he said. “She looked pretty hot. I don’t know what channel it’s on, but I’m looking forward to that.”And, he added with another laugh, “that will make news.”
