This is a summery dish to make in the middle of a cold winter (or early spring), but you can find decent cherry tomatoes even now, from Florida or from Mexico. I marinate the breasts in lemon juice, olive oil, garlic and rosemary before I pound them. This makes them very flavorful, a great savory contrast to the sweet tomato topping.Featured in: One Chicken Breast, 2 Servings And Lots Of Vegetables.
