PhotoNo matter what Éric Thomé was up to on any given day, there was almost always music playing.The 39-year-old graphic designer from the Paris suburb of Clichy was an effusive rock and electronic music fan who enjoyed discovering new artists and songs, friends said. He died, along with more than 80 others, in the attack on the Bataclan concert hall on Nov. 13.“We were always listening to music while we worked,’’ said Laurent Duvoux, an illustrator who teamed up with Mr. Thomé in 2007 to found a design studio, WeAreTed, after several years of working in advertising. “He liked talking about music and trading discs,’’ Mr. Duvoux added. “We went to a lot of concerts together.”Mr. Thomé’s and Mr. Duvoux’s studio produced bold, often whimsical illustrations for a broad range of clients that included media and telecom companies, car makers and restaurants.“We were a small agency and we liked it that way,” Mr. Duvoux said. “It was always just supposed to be Éric and me.’’Mr. Thomé was a film buff as well as a self-taught photographer, whose images had recently begun to attract critical attention. Over the summer, one of his works had appeared at a photography festival in the Southern French city of Arles and was featured again as part of an exhibition this month in Paris.The show at the Bataclan, featuring Eagles of Death Metal, was the latest in a series of concerts the two men had attended recently as Mr. Thomé, married and father to a 4-year-old girl, prepared to take a break from the live music scene in anticipation of the birth of a second daughter next month.Just weeks before, as the pair considered whether to buy tickets to see the Belgian band, 2 Many DJs, Mr. Thomé had insisted that they go.“Let’s do it now,’’ Mr. Duvoux recalled his friend telling him, “because soon I won’t have the time.”
