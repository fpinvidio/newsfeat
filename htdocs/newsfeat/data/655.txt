This simple Japanese-inflected soup has a delicate green flavor and a lovely creamy consistency. Served in small bowls, it makes a perfect beginning to a spring meal. Using white miso (shiro miso) keeps the soup light; red miso (a k a miso) gives it a nutty, more earthy flavor. Both are good. Japanese groceries sell fragrant shiso leaves in tiny bunches, and also offer the best choices for soft, silken tofu.Featured in: Peas, Emerging From The Deep Freeze.Learn: How to Make Soup
