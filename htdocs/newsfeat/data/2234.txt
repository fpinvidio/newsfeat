HOUSTON — Count me among the swelling ranks of the infatuated. I, too, have been Beto-struck.I have seen the alternative to Ted Cruz — Lord knows we need an alternative to Ted Cruz — and he’s a peppy, rangy, toothy progressive with ratios of folksiness to urbanity and irreverence to earnestness that might well have been cooked up in some political laboratory. Could that formula enable Representative Beto O’Rourke, a Texas Democrat, to wrest Cruz’s seat in the Senate from him in November?By now you’ve probably heard of Beto — seemingly no one calls him by his surname — and that in and of itself is a marvel. When else has a long-shot Senate candidate with no prior celebrity drawn so much coverage? He has been the subject of lengthy profiles in The Times, The Washington Post, Politico, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair, which bestowed upon him the mightiest political adjective of them all: “Kennedyesque.”He even appeared last month on Bill Maher’s HBO show, generating headlines with his response to Maher’s characterization of Cruz.“Don’t forget,” Maher said, “he’s a giant asshole.”“That’s true,” Beto concurred.It was a naughty swerve from his usual niceness, and over lunch in Houston on Thursday, he told me that he regretted it.
