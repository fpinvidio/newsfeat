It is human nature to want to spend money on food for an important occasion. It is not necessary, but we still do it. And every now and again, that feels good. A beautiful fillet or tenderloin of beef is something special: Even those who do not cook know that. The joy is that these cuts are simple to prepare, needing nothing except to be roasted, rested and sliced. The accompanying vegetables are not served in great heaping bowls on the table, but are chopped and added as an abundant garnish to the welcoming platter of meat. I have called this style niçoise because the components – potatoes, tomatoes, olives and beans – take their inspiration from that traditional stalwart, the salade niçoise.Featured in: At My Table; Elegance, Thy Name Is Simplicity.
