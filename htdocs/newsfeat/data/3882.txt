BOSTON, England — Workers wearing fluorescent orange clothing picked their way through rows of dark green kale, looking like inmates on a prison farm.After a long day of labor, which pays the minimum hourly wage, they return to a makeshift camp surrounded by barbed wire and security fences put up by their employer, Staples Vegetables, which supplies supermarkets across Britain and Europe. The pickers, about a thousand of them, are required to scan their fingerprints before entering the grounds.Many of these men and women are from Eastern Europe. They are in Britain legally under the European Union’s principle of freedom of movement and labor, which allows any citizen of a European Union nation to work in any other member country.
