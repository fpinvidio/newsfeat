The University of Chicago’s student body president said he would be allowed to receive his diploma and march in the university convocation ceremony Saturday, after a hearing on misconduct charges for allowing protesters into the school’s administration building to conduct a sit-in.But the student leader, Tyler Kissinger, 21, of Lewisville, N.C., said he was told by a university disciplinary committee that he would be placed on probation, which would expire when he leaves the university. He said he was also told he would be able to graduate only if he did not break any rules for the rest of his time on campus.Mr. Kissinger had faced penalties ranging from a warning to expulsion, on the eve of graduation.“It’s a relief for a lot of people — it is for me, it is for my family,” Mr. Kissinger said, after emerging from the hearing.
