The leader of the New York City Housing Authority said on Friday that her staff had turned more than 400 million records over to federal prosecutors who are reviewing tenant health and safety conditions as they try to determine whether the agency filed false claims for federal funds to address any problems.Shola Olatoye, the Housing Authority chairwoman and chief executive, said that the federal Justice Department had been looking at “every facet of our operations,” and that since the inquiry began late last year the agency had provided a wide range of documents, including repair orders and training manuals.Speaking after addressing a breakfast at New York Law School, Ms. Olatoye called the inquiry “very expansive.”“We’re taking this very seriously, and we continue to cooperate,” she said.The inquiry became public this week when the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, obtained a court order compelling the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to produce information about cases of elevated blood lead levels among public housing residents and complaints of “unsafe, unsanitary and unhealthful conditions” in housing projects.
