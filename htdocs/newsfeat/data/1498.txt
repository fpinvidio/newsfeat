For Mr. Guterres and the United Nations, the stakes are extremely high, as they are for people around the world who depend on the organization for such diverse things as childhood vaccinations, food in times of famine, peacekeepers to protect them from marauding armies, and envoys who try to bring warlords to the negotiating table. (The stakes are less critical for the United States, at least fiscally speaking: Funding for the United Nations is less than 0.1 percent of the total federal budget.)And so, Mr. Guterres, who took office Jan. 1, has pulled out all the stops to engage Ms. Haley.He hosted her for lunch in his 38th-floor dining room on the day she presented her credentials and promised a muscular American approach to diplomacy. “We’re taking names,” she said about countries that crossed the United States, before going upstairs to meet him. Mr. Guterres has since met with her at least a half dozen times and spoken to her by phone on other occasions.A former prime minister of Portugal, Mr. Guterres, 67, has tried to cast himself as the man who can deliver a leaner, nimbler United Nations — and therefore one deserving of United States support. He has deferred to the United States — perhaps too much, his critics have said. And while he has criticized the global tide of populism in generic terms, he has said little directly about Mr. Trump’s pronouncements or his policies.“I think the S.G. has found the right balance,” the French ambassador, François Delattre said on Thursday, using United Nations parlance for the secretary general. “I believe he has established excellent relations with Nikki Haley.” Mr. Delattre added: “I believe that for the S.G., and for us, too, the U.N. reform is a key priority and will remain so, which helps in current circumstances.”
