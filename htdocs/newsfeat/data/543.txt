This is a snap to make: you do no more than heat some milk with a vanilla pod, if you have one, and then beat the milk into some eggs and sugar. I don't split the pod, much as I love the sight of those aromatic little black seeds; I like the vanilla taste here to be delicate rather than perfumed. Certainly it's fine to use a good quality vanilla extract instead.The custard must be cooked in a bain-marie or water bath. You place the dish of custard in a shallow baking dish. Fill this second dish with enough boiling water to come about halfway up the sides of the custard dish. The water bath stops the custard from splitting and keeps the texture perfectly silky and smooth.Featured in: At My Table; A Feast For Two Seasons.
