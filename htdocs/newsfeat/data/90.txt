I’ve been finding all sorts of uses for finely chopped broccoli crowns lately (see my burgers from a couple of weeks ago). I make a broccoli and goat cheese spread for this sandwich. I briefly steam the broccoli, chop it finely and mash it with the goat cheese. Then I spread it on country bread, sprinkle with the nut and spice mix known as dukkah and top with the other slice of bread. The dukkah adds the surprise touch. You’ll only use half the chopped steamed broccoli in one sandwich. But you’ll want to use up the rest in another.Featured in: Grilled Cheese For Grownups.
