Kayt MathersIn October of 2010, Marcus Jernmark, the executive chef of Aquavit, created a cabbage and mushroom lasagna, a golden, bubbling layered dish of sauteed mushrooms, Napa cabbage and thinly sliced potatoes bound with a béchamel sauce, and topped with grated Västerbotten or Parmesan cheese.The dish was inspired by his roots. “My background is Swedish, and I have some French background as well,” he said. “In Sweden, we eat cabbage, kale and mushrooms in the fall.”Like most chefs, he likes to work with a trio of different kinds of mushrooms, never just one kind. “Shiitake, porcini, chanterelles, cremini and oysters are possibilities,” he said. “It’s a seasonal take on a lasagna, and it’s very home-style.”In a lush kind of way.
