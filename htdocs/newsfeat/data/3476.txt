MESA, Ariz. — President Trump blasted immigration laws and border security at a boisterous rally here on Friday, all while playing up his support among Hispanic voters.He distorted the current immigration system and the migrant caravan nearing the United States and deployed the inflammatory language of his 2016 campaign, even resurrecting the phrase “bad hombre,” a term he coined as a presidential candidate.“You’ve got some bad people in those groups,” he said. “I’ll tell you what, this country doesn’t want them.”But even as chants of “build the wall” erupted repeatedly throughout the night, Mr. Trump described his prevailing popularity with Hispanic voters, polling the crowd to see how many were in attendance. The response was lukewarm.
