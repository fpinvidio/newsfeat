Starting next month, the credit bureaus will also be required to update their public records information at least once every 90 days.That change pleases Brenda Walker, a Virginia resident with a pending lawsuit against TransUnion over the company’s monthslong delay in amending her report to show that a tax lien had been satisfied.Ms. Walker said she had been turned down for credit cards, a car loan and a student loan she tried to take out for her daughter’s education. “It wreaked havoc,” she said. “My credit score was so damaged from something that had already been paid and released.”The flip side of the change, lenders warn, is that some borrowers may now appear more creditworthy than they actually are.“This removes information from the picture that our customers get about what a borrower has done in the past,” said Francis Creighton, the chief executive of the Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents credit reporting companies. “If someone has a big bill that they owe, that’s something that should be part of the conversation.”But when the two largest credit scoring companies, Fair Isaac and VantageScore, tested what happens when tax liens and civil judgments are removed, both found that it did not meaningfully change the snapshot provided to lenders on most borrowers.More than 90 percent of people with a negative public record have other negative information on their credit file, like late payments, according to FICO’s analysis. VantageScore experimentally tweaked its model to focus on other data points, like the number of credit cards a borrower has with high balances, and found that the predictive value was almost identical.
