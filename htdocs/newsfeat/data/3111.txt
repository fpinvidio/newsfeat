A Brooklyn pastor with close ties to Mayor Bill de Blasio was arrested and then released in an unusual turn of events that included a call from the mayor to a top police commander late Monday. But the mayor’s office and the police both said Tuesday that Mr. de Blasio’s call came after a precinct commander had already decided to release the clergyman.The pastor, Bishop Orlando Findlayter of New Hope Christian Fellowship, was pulled over in Brooklyn around 11 Monday night for not signaling a left turn, the police said. Officers determined he had been driving on a suspended license and arrested him. At the station house in East Flatbush, they learned that Mr. Findlayter had two outstanding warrants stemming from an act of civil disobedience at a political rally last year.Mr. Findlayter was an early supporter of Mr. de Blasio’s mayoral campaign, and word of his arrest quickly reached the mayor. Around midnight, officials said, Mr. de Blasio called Deputy Chief Kim Y. Royster, commander of the department’s public affairs office, to inquire.In an interview, Ms. Royster said the mayor asked about the situation but did not give instruction. “I’m hearing this individual has been taken into custody,” she said, recalling the mayor’s words.
