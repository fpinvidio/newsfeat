TOKYO — With President Trump coming under international criticism for his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, his actual views on climate change remain a mystery.Does he believe, as he has repeatedly stated on Twitter, that global warming is a hoax? Or does he acknowledge that the climate is changing and that “pollutants” are involved, as Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said on CNN over the weekend?Those who seek to determine what, exactly, the president believes are “chasing a rabbit down a hole,” said Rick Perry, the United States secretary of energy, speaking to reporters in Tokyo on Monday.Mr. Perry, who was in the capital for a three-day visit to discuss nuclear power and liquid natural gas exports with Japanese officials, said the United States would “continue to be a leader in the climate issue.”
