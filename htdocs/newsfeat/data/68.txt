Sometimes I’d go with her and read Seventeen while they cackled and clinked glasses, scissors a-flutter. I knew they had something special. It should come as no surprise then that years later I clamped like a curling iron onto the first stylist of my adult life, Veronica Graff of the David Ryan salon on West 46th Street in Manhattan. We were set up by a mutual friend in 1996 and it was trust at first sight. From then on, I found myself in Veronica’s chair every six weeks, getting my highlights refreshed. It was an event that I cherished and looked forward to; a no-brainer that held zero anxiety for me. I would go to her, she would work her magic, we’d catch up, and I’d leave the salon feeling relaxed, golden and confident. But earlier this year, Veronica said she was moving. “I’m in love,” she said. How many times had I heard this throughout our 15 years together? I had seen her through a divorce, watched her son grow from a kindergartner into a hulking Brooklyn artist, and had witnessed her date a variety of men who included outlaw bikers, Cajun chefs and war veterans. But this time was different. There was a sparkling diamond ring. Veronica was marrying her childhood sweetheart and moving to Oregon. When she told me, my life (in hair styles) flashed before my eyes: the rag curls for my 30th birthday; the tasteful low ponytail for the 2002 Independent Spirit Awards; my on-again, off-again Meg Ryan shag; the angled bob with flowers behind the ears for my wedding; two long braids for the birth of my first daughter; briefly going red before getting a pixie cut following the birth of my second daughter; midlife-crisis bangs. Losing Veronica was right up there, I imagined, with losing one’s therapist. The process seemed comparable: visit, talk, laugh, cry, catharsis, self-reflection and exit, but with a new coif. What was I going to do? Would I ever trust again?See more about the collaboration and ideas for using any week’s pairing for teaching and learning »
