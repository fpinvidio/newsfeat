Grilling striped bass is a great way to cook the fish because the skin takes on a char that goes well with other strong flavors like oregano-laden chimichurri sauce. Usually paired with meat, chimichurri plays off of bass just as beautifully, as long as you use a light vinegar like champagne or rice wine, rather than balsamic. In preparing the fish, make sure the grill is hot first and be patient about flipping â€” you usually want about 4 minutes per side for a 7 to 8 ounce piece. Drop some local lacinato kale and thinly sliced yellow squash onto the grill as well for a charred vegetable side.Featured in: Visiting The Source | A Chef In The Field: Striped Bass.Learn: How to Grill
