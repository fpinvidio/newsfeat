Lorey Sebastian/Paramount PicturesIn the awards game, the Bagger is certain of one thing; don’t discount the Coen Brothers. (Don’t mess with them either; they have kind of a reputation.)Their version of “True Grit,” less a remake of the John Wayne classic than an adaptation of the Charles Portis novel, starring Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin, is one of the last entrants into the race this season. It was screened for critics late, and their thoughts were embargoed – until today.And we’re off! With a hat-tip to our pals at The Playlist, let’s do this Zagat-style, shall we?“True Grit” is a “slow-paced western character study” that shows the Coens “at the top of their game,” though it isn’t really a “Coen Brothers film.” There’s “overt sentimentality,” you see. But Mr. Bridges “hasn’t completely transformed himself” to this extent since his Dude-itude, though “13-year-old Hailee Steinfeld totally steals the show.”And yes, it is “one of the best pictures of the year.”The Bagger hasn’t seen it yet, but hears from a credible source (*cough* the big guy *cough*) that it’s a slow, elegiac, highly formal film, in style, tone and language. Will the Academy love that?Did they love the Coens’ last slow, elegiac, formal effort?There you have it.
