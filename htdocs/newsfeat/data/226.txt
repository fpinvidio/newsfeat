There’s little more comforting on a weeknight — or any night — than spaghetti, tossed in marinara sauce and paired with savory meatballs. This hearty recipe features three kinds of meat — ground pork shoulder, veal and beef chuck, along with minced bacon — rolled into small balls, which are then browned in a sauté pan, and baked until cooked through. Serve the whole thing with a bowl of grated Parmesan, ready to be heaped on.Featured in: Spaghetti And Meatballs.Learn: How to Make Pasta
