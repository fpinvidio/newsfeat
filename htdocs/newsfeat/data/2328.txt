MILAN — In the latest installment of our video series exploring the private working worlds of designers, Virgil Abloh — a designer, D.J. and first-generation American whose parents immigrated to the United States from Ghana — talks about his goal of having his Off-White label bridge the gap between street wear and haute couture, his unlikely path into fashion and the importance of using his platform as a multi-hyphenate Instagram phenomenon to promote messages of tolerance and inclusivity. The interview has been condensed and edited.Can you tell us where we are right now?Via Manin is this street off the main area in the center of Milan. It overlooks a big public park. My office has been located here for the last five years but we only moved into this new space, like, this week.Does that explain why you have no desk?I literally have no desk in the world. I work on the street, phone in hand. I’ve occasionally been stuck at the corner of Prince and Mercer Streets in Manhattan not even realizing I’ve been standing there for 20 minutes responding to messages.Being as mobile as you are — traveling 320 days a year, visiting eight different cities just this past week — is not exactly conducive to having an office routine and a fixed address.
