This omelet is fluffier and lighter than the classic. It uses Auguste Escoffier’s technique: whipping the egg whites and then gently folding in the yolks. A small amount of heavy cream enriches the omelet, making it a good candidate for a final sprinkle of powdered sugar – or a jam filling. Served sweet or savory, it’s a decadent yet ethereal dish that truly melts in the mouth.
