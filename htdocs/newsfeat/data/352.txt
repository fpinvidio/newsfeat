This is a good tabbouleh alternative for those of you who canâ€™t tolerate wheat, though you must seek out a brand of steel-cut oats that has been processed in a gluten-free facility if you need to avoid gluten. Unlike traditional tabbouleh, which is a really a parsley salad with a little bit of fine bulgur, this is more of a lemony grain salad with a generous amount of parsley and other herbs. For best results, toss the soaked oats with the dressing and refrigerate overnight.Featured in: Steel Cut Oats, Sweet And Savory.
