Cream of coconut, which is thick and sweet, is available in most supermarkets because of the popularity of pina coladas. You can, of course, use fresh coconut milk, made by removing the shell from a coconut, chopping the coconut meat and processing the meat in a blender with two cups of hot milk. For this recipe, strain the liquid and sweeten it with a quarter cup of sugar, or to taste.
