This dish is adapted from a grilled eggplant salad recipe in Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid’s wonderful book "Seductions of Rice" (Artisan, New York). Jasmine rice is an aromatic, soft, long-grain rice widely used in Thailand. The Thai dishes that employ fragrant rice are also well seasoned, so this rice is traditionally cooked without salt. I like to use my panini grill for grilling eggplant.Featured in: Rice: The WorldS Underappreciated Staple.Learn: How to Make RiceLearn: How to Grill
