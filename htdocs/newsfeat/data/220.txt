When it comes to breakfast potatoes, most people fall into one of two camps: home fries or hash browns. This recipe from Alison Roman shows you how to make an ideal batch of the hashed variety that are aggressively crisp on the outside and creamy tender on the inside. To ensure ultimate crispness, be sure to rinse the grated potatoes with cold water until the water runs nearly clear and to use a very hot, well-seasoned pan. As with all potato dishes, remember to season well.
