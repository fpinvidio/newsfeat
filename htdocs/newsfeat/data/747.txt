Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg NewsAt some of the biggest banks, there has been a revolving door to the office of chief financial officer.Bank of America said on Friday that Charles Noski, who has been finance chief for less than year, would leave that post to become vice chairman at the end of the second quarter.Mr. Noski’s early move comes just two months after the abrupt departure of Howard Atkins as chief financial officer of Wells Fargo, a mysterious exit that the bank has not explained in any detail. Timothy Sloan will assume the finance post at Wells Fargo.For its part, Bank of America has said that Mr. Noski is moving to a new position because an illness in his family is preventing his relocation to Charlotte, N.C., where the bank is based, from the West Coast. Mr. Noski had previously worked at Northrop Grumman, the Blackstone Group and AT&T.Bruce Thompson, the bank’s chief risk officer, will succeed Mr. Noski as chief financial officer.There are other newbies in the chief finance post. Douglas L. Braunstein, formerly a top investment banking executive, was named to the post at JPMorgan Chase just last June.At Citigroup, John C. Gerspach is virtually a grizzled veteran. The former chief accounting officer became chief financial officer in July 2009.Of course, it’s not surprising that there has been turnover among top finance officers at the big banks after the financial crisis and the changes in the regulatory regime. And it’s arguably a different job than it was before the crisis.As Malcolm Polley, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates, told Reuters: “Most financial institution boards put a higher degree of importance on the chief risk officer rather than the chief financial officer.”
