This excellent vegan gravy features caramelized mushrooms and a little soy sauce for depth of flavor, making it good enough to serve to your meat-eating guests, too. Just be sure to use a good-quality vegetable stock, preferably one youâ€™ve made yourself. You can simmer the gravy up to five days ahead and store it in the fridge. Reheat just before serving.
