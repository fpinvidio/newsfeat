This recipe breaks the taboo of combining seafood and cheese. This salad of blanched shrimp, new potatoes and crisp disks of sugar-snap peas is perfectly adequate. It is vibrant from fresh mint, tangy from red-wine vinegar and mustard in the vinaigrette, sweet from the shrimp and earthy from the potatoes, but a few shards of young pecorino add the saline funk that brings this dish together. The cheese will practically melt into the salad, adding a glossy complexity. (Another young, semifirm sheep’s milk cheese would work. So would aged pecorino, but use less since it’s saltier. )Featured in: A Reason For Cheese On Shrimp (No, Really).Learn: How to Cook Potatoes
