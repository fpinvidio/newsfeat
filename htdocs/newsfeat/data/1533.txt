Dozens of trucks have been moved into the border cordon between Russia and Ukraine, and sacks of foodstuffs and other supplies have been unpacked from several of the trucks. Members of the Red Cross were visible near the convoy, but not any of the contingent of 58 Ukrainian border guards waiting to inspect the trucks.Several hundred feet past the trucks, the rebel flag of Novorossiya, which resembles the Confederate flag without stars, flew over the Ukrainian border checkpoint. Rebels in the east have seized controls of large swaths of the border region, including the border checkpoint here.None of the trucks had entered Ukrainian territory as of 6 p.m. local time, a journalist who passed the Russian checkpoint into the border zone said.
