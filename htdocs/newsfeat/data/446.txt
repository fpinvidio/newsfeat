I’ve always been intrigued by olive oil cakes and decided to switch out half the butter in the original recipe for this plum cake for olive oil. I spread the batter in a 10-inch tart pan and topped it with delicious pluots from the farmers’ market. You can serve this as a dessert, a coffee cake, or a sweet snack.Featured in: Quick Breads That Are Sweet, Savory And Whole Wheat.
