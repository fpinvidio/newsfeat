The refugees keep coming.Forced from their homes by war and economic deprivation, tens of thousands of migrants made the perilous journey to Europe last month.These asylum seekers, the latest surge in a great tide of human movement, have braved winter weather, stormy seas and closed borders in their escape from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa.On Thursday in London, the European Union and international donors are expected to pledge to increase their aid to Syrians displaced by war.The toll, whether measured in lives or in dollars, is staggering.
