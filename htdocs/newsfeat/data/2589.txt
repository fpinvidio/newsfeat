Harvey Fierstein had just finished watching a preview on Wednesday night of his new play, “Casa Valentina,” when he tried, without much success, to make his way to the exit.So many well-wishers stopped him as he slowly made his way up the aisle — two middle-aged African-American women in front of him, two elderly white women behind them, the actor Joel Grey — that another theatergoer soon lost his patience. “Move it!” he yelled at the 59-year-old playwright.Mr. Fierstein kept on chatting away.Twenty minutes later, after a brief notes session with the cast and the show’s director, Joe Mantello, Mr. Fierstein walked across the street to the Glass House Tavern in Midtown, where he had booked a room for a preopening celebration.In the front, the playwright Terrence McNally was dining with the veteran gay activist David Mixner.
