BERLIN — German lawmakers on Friday approved entering into detailed negotiations for a Greek bailout amid a simmering international debate over providing more debt relief to Athens and intensifying questions about whether Greece would be better off leaving the European common currency.With resistance to providing more help to Greece growing among conservatives, 439 lawmakers voted in favor of moving ahead with the bailout deal European leaders negotiated last weekend in Brussels. There were 119 votes against, and 40 legislators abstained.Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, had urged Parliament to back the bailout, which both called “a last attempt” to order Greece’s finances and build a functioning state. It would be Greece’s third bailout in five years, and it was negotiated with the goal of keeping the country in the eurozone.But a breakdown of the vote showed that 60 members of Ms. Merkel’s conservative bloc voted against starting talks on a new package, that five abstained and that four did not vote. The size of that opposition was double the size in February, when Parliament had last voted on Greek debt relief. At the time, 29 deputies opposed the measure, and three abstained.
