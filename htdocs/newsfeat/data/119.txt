Leo Robitschek, bar manager at The NoMad in Manhattan, named this cocktail for two Little Italy streets, in homage to its Italian and American ingredients. He aimed to create a drink that was festive, like a hot spiced cider, while avoiding the rich excesses of some traditional holiday tipples. The cocktail is basically a whiskey sour armed with two secret weapons: the distinctly sweet-tart flavor of Honeycrisp apple juice and Amaro Abano, which the bartender called a “spice bomb, adding cinnamon and clove notes while adding a pleasant bitterness.” It is suited for the cocktail hour, or just before dinner.Featured in: I’ll Have A Glass Of Originality.
