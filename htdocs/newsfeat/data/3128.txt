How did you and the other players choose South Africa as the destination for the first Through Our Eyes trip, and can you talk more about the time you spent there?South Africa is someplace that interested all of us, and we thought it would be cool to go together. We ended up having the most incredible time. We went on a safari in Kruger National Park, shark diving in Gansbaai and spent a few days in Cape Town seeing all the sights like Table Mountain.But the best part was when we went to an orphanage in Cape Town, the Abaphumeleli Home of Safety, and spent time with the children there. We brought them clothes and shoes and toys like Frisbees, and they were elated and appreciative. These are things that are so basic to us, but to see the reactions that these kids had was so moving. The visit made us feel blessed about what we have and grateful that we were able to help, even only in a small way.Why did you want to include a service component on your trips?We all truly believe that giving back makes travel more satisfying because it forces you to get out of your own life and connect with others who really need it. You see the place that you’re visiting differently, but you also see your place in the world differently — our time in South Africa really put our lives into perspective.Will these trips be annual, and how will you continue to pick where you go?Ideally, we want to do two getaways a year, and we’re picking places that we all want to see, like Jamaica, where we all really wanted to go to. Once we have the destination, we will find a local charity to work with there.
