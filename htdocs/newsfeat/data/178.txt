I adapted this from an Armenian recipe that I found on the back of my packet of red lentils. Kufteh (Persian), köfte (Turkish), and kibbeh (Arabic) are round walnut size patties usually made from pounded meat (the word means “pounded”) but sometimes made with fish or vegetable pulp, mixed with fine bulgur, herbs, and spices. Serve this vegetarian version as an appetizer or a side dish.Featured in: Red Lentil And Bulgur Kufteh.
