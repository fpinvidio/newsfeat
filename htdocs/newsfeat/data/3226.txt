Panicked travelers stampeded through Kennedy International Airport on Sunday night after unconfirmed reports of gunfire there, leading the police to evacuate two terminals and close part of a major highway that runs near the airport, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said.The Port Authority said in a statement that its preliminary investigation “does not indicate shots were fired” at the airport, but that Terminals 1 and 8 were evacuated “to be cautious.” No explanation was given as to what had caused the initial reports.“There are no injuries,” the statement said. “At this time, no firearm, rounds or shell casings or other evidence of shots fired has been found.”Harry J. Wedin, chief of the special operations division of the New York Police Department, said on Twitter shortly after midnight that all affected terminals had been searched and cleared. He said no shots had been fired. The spokesman for the Port Authority, Joe Pentangelo, said no arrests had been made.
