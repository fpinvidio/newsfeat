Sherry Yard has a wonderful recipe in her first cookbook, “The Secrets of Baking,” called Roasted Voodoo Vanilla Pineapple. She roasts her pineapple with the dried vanilla pods that you save after you’ve scraped out the seeds, and fresh ginger. She inserts the pods into the flesh of the pineapple, a great idea if you’re roasting the pineapple for a long time.I decided to use vanilla extract instead of the pods, because during the relatively short time on the grill they infused only the section of the pineapple they had been stuck into. I add vanilla to the ginger syrup and baste the pineapple with this sweet and pungent mix. You could also simply drizzle the pineapple with honey.Featured in: These Fruits Were Made For Grilling.Learn: How to Grill
