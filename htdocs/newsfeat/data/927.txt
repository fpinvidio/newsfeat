Gusmano Cesaretti/HBOHBO said it suspended the filming of scenes involving horses on its drama “Luck” following the injury and euthanization of a horse involved with the production on Tuesday.“Luck,” a series set in the world of gambling and horse racing, has some of its segments filmed at the Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, Calif., where two horses were previously injured and euthanized during the filming of its current first season.On Tuesday morning, during work on an episode planned for the show’s coming second season, a horse that had passed a health and safety examination earlier in the day became injured. “The horse was on her way back to the stall when she reared, flipped over backwards and struck her head on the ground,” Dr. Gary Beck, a California Horse Racing Board veterinarian, said in a statement. He added that an attending veterinarian administered “immediate aid to the injured horse and determined that humane euthanasia was appropriate.”The American Humane Association, which monitors the use of animals in “Luck” and other television and film productions, said in a statement reported by The Associated Press that it is demanding “that all production involving horses shut down.” The statement added, “We are also insisting that this stoppage remain in full effect pending a complete, thorough and comprehensive investigation.”In a post on its blog, the advocacy group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said: “We think — and we hope law enforcement agrees — that the way in which the horses were treated by the production company, the trainer and the veterinarian warrants a swift and thorough investigation before yet another horse dies. Human affection for horses unfortunately makes them popular subjects for the film industry. Horses may grab our attention, but these animals are not willing participants in the entertainment industry.”HBO said in a statement that the network and “everyone involved with the production are deeply saddened,” and that it was “working in full cooperation” with the American Humane Association and the California Horse Racing Board on an inquiry.
