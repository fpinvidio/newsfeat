UNITED NATIONS — As the United Nations sent an eight-member human rights fact-finding mission to Ukraine on Friday, an envoy with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said she had faced noisy, threatening crowds chanting pro-Russian slogans in the Crimea regional capital of Simferopol earlier this week and had been forced to cut short her visit.The envoy, Astrid Thors, the O.S.C.E.'s high commissioner for national minorities, said that her team had been able to hold some meetings in Crimea, as planned, but not others. Word spread that she was in the city. Crowds gathered. She said she could not see if they were armed. Her team decided to cancel the rest of the meetings and return to Kiev.Ms. Thors said she could have faced the predicament that confronted a senior United Nations diplomat, Robert H. Serry, earlier this week, when he was chased out of Crimea by unidentified gunmen.“There was a risk the same could happen, that our movement could be hindered by the crowds,” Ms. Thors said in a telephone interview from her Amsterdam office. “We took precautionary principles. We shortened our stay.”
