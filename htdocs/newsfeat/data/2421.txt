State Senator Thomas W. Libous is a natural in Albany’s clubby corridors, a world away from the family grocery store in Binghamton, N.Y., where he worked growing up.A Republican with a nose for deal-making, he ascended to become one of the most powerful lawmakers in the capital and forged a close bond with a fellow political tactician, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, despite their partisan differences.But for several years, the life and career of Mr. Libous (pronounced LIB-us) faced grave threats. In 2009, he was found to have prostate cancer, which later spread to his lungs. And law enforcement officials were examining whether he had misused his office in an effort to obtain a job for his son.On Tuesday, Mr. Libous’s future grew even more troubled. He was indicted along with his son Matthew on charges that the senator had lied to federal agents and that his son had filed false tax returns. The senator and his son were charged in separate indictments.
