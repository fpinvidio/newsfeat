This is an ancient Northern Italian preparation. To improve the flavor of the meat, this powerful marinade relied on rich local wine, along with aromatic spices. Start with a relatively thin rib-eye. Marinate for one to three days. (We tried one of these steaks after a 30-minute marinade; it was good, but different. Try longer first.) The cooking should be quick and hot, in a heavy pan, for just about two minutes per side; you might generate a bit of smoke but the cooking time is short enough that it will be tolerable.Featured in: A Venetian Bath Of Wine And Spice.Learn: How to Make Steak
