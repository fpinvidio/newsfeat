LONDON — Victoria Beckham did not want her runway show on the Sunday of London Fashion Week to be seen as a homecoming.“I feel reluctant to call it a homecoming because this is not a big blockbuster event. It is not a spectacle full of specially made clothes that won’t ever go on to get made or sold, or a retrospective in any way,” Ms. Beckham said, smiling nervously. This was 24 hours before the designer commemorated the 10th anniversary of her namesake brand by unveiling her spring/summer 2019 collection here, after a decade showing in New York. She was deep in last-minute fittings for the show in a studio at her offices, scanning photo boards of models and tweaking looks, this way and that.
