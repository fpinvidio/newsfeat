VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis will travel to Cuba on Feb. 12 for a historic meeting with the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, the first meeting between a pope and the Russian patriarch, the Vatican announced on Friday.For Francis, the meeting is the result of delicate and sustained diplomacy, some of which began decades ago under Pope John Paul II, and it is another milestone in his efforts to reconcile the Roman Catholic Church with Eastern Orthodox churches. The Western and Eastern branches of Christianity split nearly 1,000 years ago.The breakthrough also highlights Francis’s ties to Cuba, as President Raúl Castro “was involved in organizing the meeting,” the Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said at a news conference.
