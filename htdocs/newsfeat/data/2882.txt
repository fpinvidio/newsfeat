Brazilians and many others are transfixed over the impeachment proceedings against Dilma Rousseff, Brazil’s first female president. But while impeachment is not uncommon, not all nations agree on what it means.Lawmakers in at least a half-dozen countries, from Iran to the United States, have subjected their leaders to impeachment in recent decades. And not every case turned out badly for the politician who was targeted.In the United States, two presidents have been impeached — Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998 — but neither had to step aside during his trial. Both were acquitted.But in Brazil, Ms. Rousseff has not yet been impeached, legal scholars say.“In Brazil, the term impeachment is used only after a conviction is made in the trial,” said Daniel Vargas, a law professor at Fundação Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro.
