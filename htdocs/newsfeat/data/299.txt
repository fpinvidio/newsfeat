Here is a recipe for a cold lobster appetizer or main course that Mark Bittman and I ginned up for a feast-in-a-day project for The Times’s Sunday Magazine in 2012. You boil the lobsters off and allow them to cool, then reduce the leftover stock to make a flavoring agent for mayonnaise. Add some chopped lobster knuckles to that, and serve a dollop of it alongside the claw and tail meat, perhaps with herbs or a chopped salad. It’s fancy food made easy.Featured in: Chicken Liver On Toast.
