China’s decision to impose a new air defense zone over a wide swath of the East China Sea is at odds with its claim to want a peaceful resolution to territorial disputes over a group of islands there. The announcement is a highly provocative move that has increased tensions and could make direct conflict with Japan more likely.On Saturday, China declared the zone around the islands, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, and asserted the right to require aircraft entering the space to identify themselves and possibly to take military action against those that do not. The uninhabited islands, some no more than piles of rocks, are administered by Japan but claimed by China and Taiwan.For more than a year, China and Japan, the world’s second- and third-largest economies, have been increasingly confrontational over the issue. Japan’s hypernationalist government led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has most often been the provocateur, but China has contributed to the instability by deploying Chinese coast guard ships and aircraft to the area to challenge Japan’s claims. The air defense zone goes even further in contesting Japan’s control by aggressively asserting China’s reach in the region. It significantly complicates efforts by the United States to develop a relationship with China under President Xi Jinping.Asian airlines quickly fell in line and said they would inform China of their flight plans before entering the disputed airspace. But the unilateral power grab rightly angered Tokyo and Washington. On Saturday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, as part of a rapid American response, made it clear that the announcement “will not in any way change how the United States conducts military operations in the region” and reaffirmed America’s treaty obligation to aid Japan if it were attacked. On Monday, Mr. Abe vowed to defend his nation’s airspace.
