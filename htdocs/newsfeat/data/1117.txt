Michael Kirby Smith for The New York TimesNo doubt you can work up an appetite flinging a bowling ball down the alley, so the 90,000-square-foot bowling complex in the former New York Times newsroom, off Times Square, has a 220-seat restaurant, Stadium Grill, with stadium-style seating and an 80-foot bar. The restaurant menu and the menu available at the lanes are by David Burke.Each of the bowling alley areas has a theme, like Chinatown and Times Square, with food, but the food is not particularly New York oriented. Mr. Burke pushes the typical sports bar envelope with Chinese chicken wings, meatloaf with garlic prawns, sausage and shrimp macaroni and cheese, and cured salmon pizza. Many of the Stadium Grill menu items are also available at the various bowling lanes.Stadium Grill, 222 West 44th Street, (212) 680-0012.
