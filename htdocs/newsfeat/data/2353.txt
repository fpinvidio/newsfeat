“Thank you Kirk for standing by me through all the noise.” That was Kanye West on Twitter a few days ago, sharing his appreciation for Kirk Franklin, a pillar of the gospel music world for more than two decades who had worked on “Ultralight Beam,” the soaring opening number from Mr. West’s latest album, “The Life of Pablo.” Two top talents in collaboration — easy enough, right?But for Mr. Franklin, work with Mr. West — a secular and often profane public figure for whom spiritual fervor is but one part of his creative arsenal — comes with liabilities, as Mr. Franklin noted lately. Yet when Mr. West called, Mr. Franklin delivered, reportedly arranging the choir for “Ultralight Beam” in just a few minutes. And at this year’s Stellar Awards — the gospel music industry’s annual celebration — Mr. Franklin delivered a rousing performance that managed to tweak the genre’s traditions while never making it anything less than clear where his faith lay.
