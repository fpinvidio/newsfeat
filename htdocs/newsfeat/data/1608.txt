Since the Charleston church shooting, pressure has mounted on South Carolina to stop displaying the Confederate battle flag on the grounds of its State Capitol in Columbia, S.C. On Monday, Gov. Nikki R. Haley and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called for the flag's removal.Supporters of the flag have said they view the shooting and the flag as unrelated. And a Winthrop University poll last fall found that 62 percent of South Carolina residents had positive or neutral feelings toward the flag. But Cornell William Brooks, the national president of the N.A.A.C.P., has called it an emblem of hate. “That symbol must be removed from our state capital,” he said last week.
