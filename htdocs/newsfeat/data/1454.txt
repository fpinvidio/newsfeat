The six largest American banks got permission to pay out a combined sum of more than $125 billions in the form of increased dividends, which reward investors for every share of stock they own, and share buybacks, which increase the value of a company’s stock by reducing the number of shares outstanding.The only bank to fail the stress test was the American arm of Germany’s Deutsche Bank, which Fed officials sharply criticized for “widespread and critical deficiencies” in how it handles its capital and manages its finances. The Fed’s grievances mean Deutsche Bank will be restricted from transferring money from the United States to its Frankfurt headquarters, potentially making its Wall Street operations less lucrative at a time when the bank’s top executives are already mulling cuts to that business.In an emailed statement, the American arm of Deutsche Bank said that it “continues to make progress across a range of programs and will continue to build on these efforts and to engage constructively with regulators to meet both internal and regulatory expectations.”The Fed also dealt an embarrassing blow to Goldman and Morgan Stanley, which each fell below minimum capital levels. The banks were given “conditional approval” to return money to shareholders, but they were required to keep their shareholder payouts near last year’s levels and work on beefing up their capital cushions over the next year.But that is likely to be only a temporary hiccup for the two Wall Street titans. Goldman and Morgan Stanley fell short largely because the tax law that Mr. Trump signed late last year caused them to record large, one-time accounting losses. Going forward, the cuts will most likely generate enormous tax savings for both firms, which would make it easier for them to win approval to reward shareholders.
