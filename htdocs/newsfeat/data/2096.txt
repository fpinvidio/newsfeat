TD Securities, which had predicted an increase in June, said it now expected none until September.“Relax and enjoy your summer!” said Craig Bishop, lead strategist for the fixed income group at RBC Wealth Management, writing off a rate increase until November.The Fed already had backed away from its December projection that it would raise rates four times this year. Officials in March predicted just two rate increases. But Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said this month that she did not regard the December increase as a mistake, and she and other officials have continued to suggest that more moves are likely this year.“I said at the time and continue to feel that the economy had made very substantial progress,” Ms. Yellen said at an event in New York.Other officials, too, have cautioned against assuming too much caution.“I do not see that the risks are so elevated, nor the outlook so pessimistic, as to justify the exceptionally shallow interest rate path currently reflected in financial futures markets,” Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in New Britain, Conn., last week.While the Fed’s latest statement acknowledged the weakness of some recent economic data, it also noted a number of reasons that growth could gain strength.“Much of the weakness in economic activity that manifested in recent data appears to have been downplayed in the statement and is in any case largely in the rear view as far as the committee is concerned,” said Michael Dolega, a senior economist at TD Bank.For example, there is a divide in the recent rounds of government data between the reported strength of job growth and the reported weakness of overall economic activity. The early estimates of job growth are historically more accurate, and the Fed’s choice of language suggested Fed officials think the reported economic weakness may be overstated. The statement described job growth as improved but said economic growth “appears” to have slowed.
