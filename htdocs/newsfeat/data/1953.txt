ArgentinaNational elections bring an official end to 12 years of “Kirchnerismo,” the political movement named for President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and her late husband, Néstor Kirchner. The Kirchners expanded social benefits, nationalized companies, taxed agricultural exports, feuded with American hedge funds and tried to curb media conglomerates.After winning four-year terms in 2007 and 2011, Mrs. Kirchner was constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive term.But it remains unclear who will succeed her. The mayor of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, made a surprisingly strong showing, and will face the front-runner, Daniel Scioli, in a runoff on Nov. 22.Mr. Scioli, a former vice president who was endorsed by Mrs. Kirchner, took 35.7 percent of the vote with 84 percent of balloting stations tallied, against 35.3 percent for Mr. Macri.Mr. Macri appeals to voters who believe Mrs. Kirchner’s economic policies have isolated the country and who see her as imperious. He could take the election if he aligns with a third candidate, Sergio Massa, a centrist who leads a party called the Renewal Front and took 21 percent of the vote.Latest Story: In Argentina Elections, Tight Vote Yields Presidential Runoff
