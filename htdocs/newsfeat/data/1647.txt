It was a mild Saturday evening, with throngs of people in parks, on the streets and in restaurants in Manhattan. And then a bomb blast jolted a street in Chelsea with enough force to lift a Dumpster into the air, shattering windows and injuring 29 people. The violence was accentuated by the uncertainty: What had happened, and why, and who had carried it out?Videos, some recorded on cellphones and security cameras, provided a crucial depiction of the explosion and its aftermath, a record of moments that would not have been so keenly felt for many otherwise: the chilling before and after of the street in Chelsea, images of the blast and its force, and one witness's chance to document the scene and express himself in a moment of fear.
