The success is not entirely unexpected, as the team has assembled a strong group of players for the division. “We got established league players that we knew could play at that level,” Perez said. “We had tryouts across North America.” The team includes three players who have captained their national teams: Ryan Burroughs of the United States, Rhys Jacks of Canada and Bob Beswick of Ireland.Perez is not expecting to hang around the third tier very long: “The short term goal is to get promoted, the three-year plan is to get into the Super League, the five-year plan is to win the Super League,” the top level of rugby league in England. “Toronto doesn’t win anything, so I’d like to reverse that.”A sports team whose rivals are all on another continent poses a series of unconventional problems, but Perez is optimistic that flexible scheduling and modern technology will mitigate any difficulties for the Wolfpack.The team is playing its first five league games in England to cut down on air travel (and give the Canadian weather time to warm up), and this is expected to continue in the seasons to come. The team members who do not live in England already are staying in a rented mansion 15 minutes from the team’s training center in Leeds.Later in the season, though, the team will have to fly back and forth on multiple occasions.“It’s only a five-hour time difference and a six-hour flight,” Perez said. He also said he was not too concerned about squeezing big men into coach seats. “There are no fat guys in rugby league. It’s one of the most cardiovascularly difficult sports in the world.”
