A twist on the Cantonese classic ginger-scallion sauce, this aromatic pur√©e focuses on the flavor of scallions slow-cooked to draw out their gentle sweetness. Adding more scallions at the end brings a fresh complexity to the sauce, but if you want to keep the whole thing mellow and sweet, feel free to omit that step, and just cook all the scallions at once. It's great as a dressing for noodles, boiled or roasted vegetables and simple meats and fish.Featured in: Caramelized Scallion Sauce Will Never Go Viral (But It Should).
