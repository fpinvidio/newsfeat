One of my favorite dishes, which is hard to find properly made in Italian restaurants, is a good minestrone. This hardy vegetable soup is especially delicious poured on top of a mound of steamed Swiss chard or kale, and garnished with a green extra virgin Tuscan olive oil and freshly grated Parmesan. If you have any leftover rinds of Parmesan cheese, they can be cooked in the soup and will give it flavor. Serve the soup with toasted Italian bread spread with olive oil and rubbed with crushed garlic.Featured in: Food; Hearty Soups.
