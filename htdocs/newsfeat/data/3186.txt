SANA, Yemen — Houthi rebels here said on Sunday that they had agreed to a five-day cease-fire proposed by Saudi Arabia that would allow humanitarian relief supplies to be delivered to the country, according to statements carried by a Houthi news agency.Yet as the Houthis accepted the limited truce, the Saudi-led military coalition bombed the residential compound of Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen’s former president and the Houthis’ most important ally in the war. The residence, in Sana, the Yemeni capital, was struck at least seven times early Sunday, witnesses said. Mr. Saleh, who survived, made a defiant statement on television afterward, standing amid the rubble of his compound.The cease-fire would begin at 11 p.m. Tuesday. Since proposing a halt in the hostilities last week, the Saudi-led coalition has escalated its bombing campaign, apparently trying to inflict as much damage as possible on the Houthis and their allies before any pause in the conflict.The airstrikes on Mr. Saleh’s residence and in the northern province of Saada, a Houthi stronghold, also seemed to reflect the Saudi-led coalition’s desire to claim a military victory — perhaps by killing pro-Houthi leaders — after a six-week campaign that analysts say has failed to meet most of its stated goals.
