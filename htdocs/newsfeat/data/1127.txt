VideoIn this weekâ€™s column, I mention a homemade rhubarb compote that I used as a topping for pancakes. I demonstrate the recipe in this video if you want a detailed look at how to make it, though it is simple as can be. Just cube 3/4 pound rhubarb and combine it with 3/4 cup sugar over low heat. When the rhubarb starts to soften, but before it falls apart (about 5 minutes), use a slotted spoon to transfer it to a bowl. Then, cook the liquid down in the pan until it thickens and turns syrupy (about 5 minutes longer). This condenses and intensifies the rhubarb flavor. Add the syrup to the bowl with the rhubarb and let cool. It will keep for at least a week in the fridge.Easy, and wonderful to have around, whether you eat it on pancakes, yogurt or just a spoon.
