“If you watch some of the shows that go on during the day, it’s harkening back to the heroic deeds of the Soviet Army, liberating the Crimea and Sevastopol,” said Vladimir V. Pozner, host of a political talk show on Channel One. “You begin to be very antsy — is this the buildup to something else? Is this not preparing the population for what ultimately will be the use of force?”He added that he believed that American and European television channels were also selective in their depiction of the crisis. “There’s a kind of new Cold War going on,” he said.As a whole, Russians take a view of the conflict vastly at odds with their counterparts in the West, and that is in part the result of the news media. In a poll conducted in late February by the All-Russian Public Opinion Center, which works closely with the Kremlin, 29 percent of respondents described the events in Ukraine as “rampant anarchy and banditry,” 25 percent described them as “a coup and overthrow of the state” and 27 percent saw them as the outbreak of a civil war.There have, however, been some challenges to the Kremlin’s depiction of the on-the-ground realities, especially in Crimea.On Sunday, the Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights, a group that advises the Kremlin, released a statement signed by 27 of its members describing government reports of attacks on civilians in Crimea — the main pretext for Russian intervention — as “unreliable and exaggerated,” based on reporting done by two members who traveled to Crimea. Pavel Chikov, one of the members, said he noticed the deputy head of Mr. Putin’s administration sitting quietly in the audience Tuesday during a stormy discussion of the statement. “I would say that it was very sensitive to the presidential administration for sure because it was a move inside the administration against presidential policy,” he said.
