A galette is the perfect dessert for anyone who thinks the crust-to-fruit ratio of the average pie is way off. In a galette, the fruit filling is thinner, so you have more flaky pastry to every bite. It also means a galette cooks a bit faster and can be sliced while warm, a boon for the impatient. Don't be alarmed if your galette leaks as they most often do. The final product never seems to suffer.
