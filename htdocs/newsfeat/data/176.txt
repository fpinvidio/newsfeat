You’ve probably made some kind of Mexican casserole layered with tortillas, beans, and plenty of melted cheese before (and if you haven’t, now is the time). But this one is bolder, brighter and more deeply flavored, thanks to pasilla chiles in the sauce, lime zest in the luscious crema topping, and chorizo in the beans. If you’d prefer a vegetarian version, leave out the chorizo. But do seek out the pasilla chiles (also called negra chiles), which add their inimitable smoky, fruity spice. This casserole reheats perfectly and will keep for at least five days in the fridge.Featured in: The Casserole Catches Up.Learn: How to Cook Beans
