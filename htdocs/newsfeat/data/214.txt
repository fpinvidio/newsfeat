This recipe is perfect for a small batch of mayonnaise and does not require a food processor. Whisk slowly as you drip the oil into the egg yolk, lemon juice and Dijon mustard mixture. Once it starts to emulsify, you can start adding the oil a bit faster. In all, itâ€™ll be a few minutes of whisking for a beautiful light-yellow mayo that's worth every moment.Featured in: Mayonnaise: Oil, Egg And A Drop Of Magic.
