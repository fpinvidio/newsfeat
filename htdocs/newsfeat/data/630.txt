This no-cook, three-ingredient cranberry sauce from Daniel Humm, the chef of Eleven Madison Park and NoMad in New York, could not be simpler. Just toss cranberries, sugar and orange zest into the bowl of a mixer with a paddle attachment (a food processor won't work), flip it on the lowest setting and go about your business for an hour. When you return, you'll have a bright, chunky chutney that has more flavor and personality than the cooked sort.Featured in: Cranberry Chutney.
