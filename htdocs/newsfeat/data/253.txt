Ssamjang, meaning "sauce for wraps" in Korean, has a wonderful combination of sweet, spicy and salty elements. It’s like American barbecue sauce, which makes sense, as it’s often used with grilled Korean specialties like bulgogi (marinated shaved beef), galbi (thinly sliced short ribs) and pork belly.Its main ingredient, doenjang, is a slow-fermented soybean paste that is similar to Japanese miso, providing the same rich umami flavor. Any Asian food market would stock multiple brands of doenjang; one of our favorite Korean cooking teachers, Emily Kim, a.k.a. Maangchi, advises simply, "Buy the most expensive one!"Featured in: Maangchi: You Tube’s Korean Julia Child.
