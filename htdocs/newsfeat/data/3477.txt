Newly paved last year, the track should have more grip now as other racing series have been using it. But the altitude remains a key factor. At 7,218 feet, or 2,200 meters, above sea level, it is by far the highest track in the Formula One series, and that affects such factors as drivers’ stamina, aerodynamic drag and engine power.With only 78 percent of the oxygen available at sea level, the engines have more difficulty breathing, though today’s cars do benefit from electronic energy recovery systems and turbocharged engines with forced induction.The cooling and aerodynamics are also affected, as the less dense air provides less downforce and drag. “Less dense air also means you can’t cool everything you want to be cooled as well as would be the case at lower ground levels,” said Nick Chester, the Renault team’s chassis technical director.Because of the lack of drag, teams use downforce levels on the wings similar to those they use at the season’s slowest track through the streets of Monaco, to have more grip in the corners. But, unlike in Monaco, the straight-line speeds are very high because of the reduced air density.To help cool the engine and gearbox, the teams carve out vents, or gills, in the bodywork, particularly on the side of the cockpit, and the airbox. They also use larger brake ducts.The track remains an all-around style of circuit, with every type of corner and straight. The first sector consists of a series of twisty corners, the second is a series of tight corners, the third has high-speed corners and the final sector has the fastest corner of the circuit.There are seven left-hand corners and 10 right-hand corners, but the eight-tenths of a mile pit straight has the biggest influence on car setup. To reach a top speed of about 200 miles per hour, the cars must find the best tradeoff between aerodynamic downforce and drag. And that, of course, is complicated by the problem of the altitude.
