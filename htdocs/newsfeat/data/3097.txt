Salah and Ibrahim AbdeslamSalah and Ibrahim Abdeslam, both involved in the Paris attacks of Nov. 13, 2015, seem to have become radicalized together. It happened over the last couple of years while they were running a bar in their hometown, Molenbeek, a district of Brussels.Ibrahim, the older of the two, died when he detonated a suicide vest in Le Comptoir Voltaire, a cafe in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. Salah appears to have been principally a logistician and organizer, and the authorities say he was the sole surviving Paris attacker. He was captured on March 18 in Brussels after evading investigators for 125 days, and charged with terrorist murder.
