Good morning on this mild Monday.New Yorkers will head to the polls tomorrow to vote for House and Senate candidates in the federal primaries.Well, a few of us will.Many New Yorkers may think of themselves as politically woke and especially attuned to national and global events. But an interest in politics doesn’t always translate to voting: New York’s voter turnout record is embarrassingly low.“It’s abysmal,” said Doug Muzzio, a professor of political science at Baruch College. “You have an attentive public, but that’s a small percentage of the population. Most people in New York don’t pay attention to elections, and they only remember soundbites.”Only 12 percent of eligible New Yorkers voted in the mayoral primaries last year, according to the city Board of Elections, and only 26 percent voted in the general election in November.
