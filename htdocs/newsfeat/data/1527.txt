WASHINGTON — A District of Columbia bar committee has agreed to a deal that would let a former Justice Department lawyer keep his law license even though he said he was one of the sources for a 2005 article in The New York Times about the National Security Agency’s program of wiretapping without the court-approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying.The deal calls for a “public censure” of the lawyer, Thomas M. Tamm, who admitted revealing confidential client information and could have had his law license suspended or been disbarred. That reprimand would enable him to continuing practicing law as an assistant public defender in Maryland.If approved by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the deal would end a decade of investigations into Mr. Tamm. The Justice Department said in 2010 that it had decided not to prosecute him for a crime, but in December, in a surprise move, the District of Columbia bar revived ethics charges against him.“This has been going on forever,” said Mr. Tamm’s lawyer, Paul Kemp. “It has taken a huge toll on Tom, and it’s time to end it.”
