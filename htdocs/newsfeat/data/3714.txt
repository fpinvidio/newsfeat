More than 500 women and teenagers will be bailed out from Rikers Island as part of a national campaign to dismantle a bail system that activists say discriminates against minorities and the poor.The effort is being spearheaded by the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights group, which plans to raise at least $5 million to fund the releases. While there have been other so-called mass bailouts around the country, organizers said they believe this effort at Rikers has the potential to be one of the largest ever.“The crux of the issue is that in New York City, we criminalize poverty,” Kerry Kennedy, president of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, said in an interview on Wednesday. “There are no wealthy people on Rikers Island because if you are wealthy, you go free because you make bail.“For a week or 10 days, we want to show we can have a system of justice that works,” she added.The group has organized 200 volunteers who, starting in October, will bail women out from the Rose M. Singer Center, and will arrange the release of 16- and 17-year-olds from the Robert N. Davoren Complex, perhaps aiding the city in its goal to close those jails more quickly than planned.
