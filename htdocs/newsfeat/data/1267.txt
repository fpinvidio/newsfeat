The apartment, which offers striking park and river vistas from its many floor-to-ceiling windows, is roughly 5,250 square feet, with five bedrooms and six and a half baths.The unit has a private elevator landing that opens to a stately gallery with a black-and-white checkered floor and a powder room. The gallery leads to the three main public spaces: a library with built-in bookcases and a fireplace, a formal wallpapered dining room and a 30-by-20-foot living room with built-in display cabinets and the second fireplace. Off the dining room are a breakfast room and a large eat-in windowed kitchen, with a service elevator, laundry and two staff rooms sharing a bath nearby.At the back of the apartment, off a long hallway, is a private wing that contains the five en-suite bedrooms and a family room/playroom fashioned from two maid’s rooms. The large master suite has two walk-in closets and a tiled bathroom.“It’s all so properly laid out,” Ms. Boardman said. “It’s a real family apartment.”Ms. Spring, who is a managing director of J. P. Morgan Private Bank, said she and her siblings have fond memories of their childhood home.
