This crunchy, colorful stir-fry has an added kick from serrano chiles. I can’t resist buying an array of beans when they’re at summer farmers’ markets. I love to mix yellow and green beans in this crunchy, colorful stir-fry, but don’t hesitate to make it if all you can find is green. For added kick and color I threw in some serrano chiles from my garden that had ripened to bright red. Thai chiles will work too.Featured in: Stir Fries With A Touch Of Thai.
