PhotoLAS VEGAS — The post-debate spin room is officially dangerous for candidates.Physically dangerous.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and his wife, Jane, were so inundated by a large and crowding news media mass in the spin room that they had to rely on hotel security to keep the crowds at bay.It began with Mr. Sanders taping an interview with Chris Matthews on MSNBC in a booth on the far side of the room. Finishing the interview, he was greeted by a swell of reporters and cameras, and he answered questions about what he wished had been talked about in the debate.As he made his way toward the exit, and hotel security guards tried to clear a path, cameras and reporters kept cycling to the front, eventually bringing the scrum to a halt near the door while he continued to answer questions.Then, as he exited the hall to yet another scrum, and the mass of slow moving feet turned into pushing and elbowing as cameras jockeyed for position, Mr. Sanders had had enough.“Excuse me,” he shouted, a hand raised in the air. “Please move. Stop this.”The herd only swelled further. So Mr. Sanders placed a hand on the back of a security guard, and started to make for the exit. But his pace was too quick, and his wife was stuck back in the stampede of reporters and cameramen.He stopped his entourage. “Jane,” he yelled.She was escorted quickly to the front of the line, and they made their way through a few rooms before escaping into an elevator.But the candidate wasn’t rattled. He told reporters as he was leaving that he was “feeling great,” and joked, “Well, I think there is some interest, and maybe some people think we did O.K. tonight.”
