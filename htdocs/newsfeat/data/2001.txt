FRIDAY PUZZLE — I would so love to wax poetic over this excellent Robyn Weintraub puzzle, but I’m terribly distracted now by all these things I suddenly remembered I was going to do this week: Plan the Thanksgiving menu, get my roots done, clean out the dryer vent, milk the sheep … And I’m really craving Chinese food for some reason.Tricky CluesMs. Weintraub is an expert cluer of end-of-the-week puzzles, and today’s grid is chock-full of delights and challenges. I loved the bookends she mentions in her notes — both debuts, surprisingly! And beyond the tough stuff, every second fill entry made me smile as well — things like PERSON, CLUBS and SCHMO, for example.I liked the fliers (I know, penguins don’t count) — witches, geese, stages and churches. I also liked the little stack of financial references to “bucks,” “time” and a GOLD COIN.17A: Dressing vs. stuffing, let the battle commence. I feel like I’ve trotted this map out before. I tend to think of dressing as oil and vinegar, and upon settling upon STALE BREAD here, thought, “Hm! Panzanella?” before realizing that yipes, it’s October. I made gluten free stuffing year before last, I think, and it was no bueno. I’m sure there’s a way but every day is a day to give thanks for bread, if your system tolerates it.
