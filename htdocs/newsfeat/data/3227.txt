WASHINGTON — In 2004, relatives of some American citizens killed or injured by terrorist attacks in Israel sought redress in an unusual way. They filed a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against Arab Bank, the largest financial institution in Jordan, accusing it of transferring funds to Hamas leaders and other terrorists responsible for the attacks.A decade later, the case has provoked a significant split in the Obama administration, according to current and former officials, pitting the State Department, which wants the administration to come to the bank’s aid, against the Treasury and Justice Departments, which want the government to stay out of it. The case is scheduled to go to trial in August.But Arab Bank has asked the Supreme Court to intervene now and overturn sanctions imposed by the trial judge when the bank refused to turn over private customer records. The Supreme Court has asked whether the government thinks it should hear the case, and the Obama administration is at an impasse over what to tell the justices.The quandary facing the administration stems from the unusual trade-offs between issues that are rarely linked, including diplomatic efforts to achieve Middle East peace, the rights of American victims of terrorism, and an American campaign to tear down Swiss banking secrecy laws that have long aided tax evasion.
