This salad was a big surprise. It is so simple. I began with a bulb of fennel and some celery that I had on hand in the refrigerator, the remains of a bag of black quinoa, and fresh herbs from my garden, thinking that I would need to add some unexpected ingredients to achieve something interesting. But the contrasts of textures and the crisp, clean flavors of the fennel and celery in a lemony dressing made for a salad that I canâ€™t resist. Slice the fennel and celery as thin as you can.Featured in: Black Quinoa, Fennel And Celery Salad.Learn: How to Make Salad
