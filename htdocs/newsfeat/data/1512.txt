In 2013, Travis Reginal wrote an essay in Education Life about making his way from Jackson, Miss., to Yale, as a first-generation student. In his admissions essay, he had examined his love of writing poetry. He updates his journey, in his favorite format.My room appears as if it were just the first week of school.Most of my belongings still lie in boxes.The items that are out seem to have been tossed about randomly,Finding no spot in particular to call home.•Hands on hips, I look at where to start.Even though I am almost through my junior year, it’s not too late
