Want a juicy steak dinner on the fly? Skirt steak is fast, flavorful and forgiving. With a searing-hot grill and a quick marinade (30 minutes does the trick), you can yield a deeply charred, flavor-packed crust with a tender inside. Make sure not to overcook this; medium to medium-rare is ideal. The equally fast side of shaved kale, fennel and crumbled feta is a willing accompaniment to any steak dinner, and just as at home with a pork tenderloin or chops. Raisins, a subtle addition, add a bit of natural sweetness, but skip them if youâ€™re raisin-averse.
