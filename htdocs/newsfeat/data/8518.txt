NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar — Efforts by Myanmar’s democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, to negotiate her way to the presidency this year have failed, associates of hers confirmed on Monday, highlighting the challenges her party faces as it prepares to take power on April 1.The setback is just one sign of potential difficulty for the party, the National League for Democracy, when it succeeds a quasi-military government that has ensured the armed forces will continue to have significant authority.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and tight-lipped party officials here in the capital have revealed little of their intentions. Three weeks before it will take over, the party has yet to announce a program or plan of action for the new government. And even though it holds a majority of the seats in Parliament, which will elect the next president, it has yet to reveal its candidate.“We don’t want any controversy because of our predictions and our interviews,” said U Win Htein, a senior party member and one of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s closest advisers. “We just want to be low key.”
