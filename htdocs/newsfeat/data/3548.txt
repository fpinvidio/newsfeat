RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil’s Senate voted in the early hours of Wednesday to begin the last phase in the impeachment trial of Dilma Rousseff, the president who was suspended in May, setting the stage for her final removal from office.After hours of debate in the capital, Brasília, senators voted 59 to 21 on Wednesday to indict Ms. Rousseff on charges of budgetary manipulation, formally making her a defendant. The trial in the Senate, which will be overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, is expected to take place this month.“It marks the final phase,” said Ivar Hartmann, a law professor at Fundação Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro.Although only a simple majority was needed in Wednesday’s vote, the number of senators who went against Ms. Rousseff exceeded the two-thirds needed to oust her permanently when a final vote is held after the trial, a sign that she faces long odds of surviving.
