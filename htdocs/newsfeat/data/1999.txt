WASHINGTON — Imagine a week in which you arrange the halftime show for the Super Bowl, organize the trophy ceremony for the World Cup and then, for good measure, plan your daughter’s wedding.That is the kind of week ahead for Deesha Dyer, the new White House social secretary. President Obama will host Pope Francis on Wednesday, President Xi Jinping of China on Thursday and hundreds of guests at a White House state dinner for Mr. Xi on Friday. The president will then fly to New York to entertain a conclave of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly.In between, the White House is expecting nearly 15,000 guests to witness the pope’s Wednesday morning arrival on the South Lawn.“We’ve never had anything like this before,” said Jessica Andrews, a spokeswoman for the State Department’s chief of protocol. “It’s the Super Bowl of Super Bowls.”
