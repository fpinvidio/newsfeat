This rub comes from Alan Ashkinaze, the longtime chef de cuisine for Laurent Manrique, a celebrity chef of sorts. Steak, in Mr. Ashkinaze’s view, is crucial to the enjoyment of a grilled salad. And by steak, he means rib-eye, thick cut, on the bone.“I put a rub on it,” he said. “Cooking at home, over a charcoal fire, I want to have some spice and sugar to help make a crust.” He mixes sugar and salt, paprika and ancho-chile powder, tamps it all down with cumin, celery seeds, a little faux-Southern onion and garlic powder to create a mixture that manages not to obscure the meat’s beefiness but somehow to intensify it.Featured in: Grilled Caesar Salad.Learn: How to Make SteakLearn: How to Grill
