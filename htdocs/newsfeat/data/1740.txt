These events had long been mysterious; some 19th-century natural philosophers viewed the reboot of the biosphere that followed them as evidence of separate acts of divine creation. With the introduction of the Alvarez hypothesis, there was now a plausible and testable mechanism for these apocalypses. Geologists set out across the planet, scouring the fossil record for evidence of asteroid impacts at each of the other crises in Earth’s history. They came up empty.Plausible candidates, like the 62-mile-wide Manicouagan crater in Quebec, now a circular system of lakes, seemed to fit the bill. The asteroid that created it was large enough, computer models showed, to have wiped out up to a third of life on Earth. But when the crater was dated, there was no evidence of such a catastrophe.Other enormous impacts, like the one that created the Chesapeake Bay 35 million years ago, left no discernible echoes in the fossil record, either.While evidence for asteroids at the other mass-extinction boundaries was hard to come by, researchers did find a coincidence in time with continent-flooding cascades of lava on a scale unimaginable today.How these lava flows, known as large igneous provinces, rendered their destruction is an active area of study, but some clear signatures appear at many of the episodes, including huge injections of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, intense global warming and ocean acidification as carbon dioxide was absorbed by the seas.In Siberia, one such volcanic province spewed so much carbon into the air that parts of the ocean reached — as one paleontologist put it — the temperature of “hot soup.” Seas became more acidic, as they are becoming today, and calcifying animals like corals died en masse, along with 96 percent of ocean life during the End-Permian extinction.We now know, through the dating of the Palisades across from New York City, that 50 million years later, virtually the same thing happened at the end of the Triassic, when lava gushed from the seams of the supercontinent Pangaea as it tore apart.
