Once again, Americans are facing a tragedy involving guns. This time, at least 10 people were killed during an attack at a Texas high school Friday.More than five years have passed since the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where 20 children and six adults were killed. In that time, dozens of gun safety proposals have been introduced in Congress attempting to fix glaring issues with gun safety and regulation. More than 1,600 mass shootings have taken place in America since then.
