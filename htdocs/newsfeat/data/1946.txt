Declan Walsh, our bureau chief in Cairo, is reporting on the 2016 American presidential campaign for a global audience in much the same way he would cover an event overseas.He spent a week in Cleveland, where Republicans nominated Donald J. Trump for president, and then traveled to Philadelphia for the Democratic convention, where Hillary Clinton became the first woman nominated by a major political party for the nation’s highest office.Declan will continue to cover the race through November for “Abroad in America,” and you can follow him on Instagram, where he is sharing pictures of what he sees on the campaign trail.
