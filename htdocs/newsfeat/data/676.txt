Lamb typically goes beautifully with a wide range of red wines. Simpler preparations are great foils for the best bottles of well-aged Bordeaux, northern Rhônes or Riojas. This pulled shoulder recipe, with its sweet and spicy flavors, is more appropriate for casual bottles that will please and refresh without requiring your full attention. A fruity Rioja crianza would work well, as would a Crozes-Hermitage from the northern Rhône. An easygoing Loire red would be terrific, as would a modestly priced Oregon pinot noir. Any number of Italian reds would be delicious: Montepulciano d’Abruzzo, for one, and some lovely little-known grapes like teroldego from Trentino and lagrein from the Tyrolean northeast. For an afternoon meal outdoors, you could easily serve a good dry rosé. Chill lightly and enjoy. ERIC ASIMOV
