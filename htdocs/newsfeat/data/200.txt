Harold Dieterle, the chef and an owner of two restaurants in Manhattan, Perilla and Kin Shop, cooks food that is often fiery and always immensely detailed. It resembles intricate music that is played very, very loud. This Jamaican-style jerk sauce is no exception. Its heat is towering, but it does not overwhelm the flavors that accompany the flames: thyme and allspice, along with wisps of caramelized sugar and a scent of rum. “You could serve it on chicken,” Dieterle told me. “It’s insane on ribs.” Not to mention pork tenderloin and bluefish. Jerk tofu? That’d be terrific as well.Featured in: Jerk Was Meant To Be Messed With.Learn: How to Grill
