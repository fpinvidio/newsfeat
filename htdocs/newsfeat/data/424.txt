I grew up in Oklahoma City, where barbecue and smoked meats are pretty much a prerequisite for family gatherings. And yet, like many families, Thanksgiving around my house included the traditional turkey and ham, which got a little boring. Pastrami brings something different to the table. The idea is to keep the prep simple; the meat takes a long time to cook, but once you have it in the oven or smoker, you don’t have to attend to it. It easily feeds a large crowd and, since it isn’t your typical Thanksgiving centerpiece, it will be a conversation starter. Serve it with plenty of hot mustard.Featured in: A Chef Regains His Focus.
