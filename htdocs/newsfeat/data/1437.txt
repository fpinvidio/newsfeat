The business of Charleston is tourism, with more than four million visitors each year. Even some African-Americans here said there was no reason to suspend that business, even after one of the worst racist attacks in recent American history.“You can’t let something like that stop your life,” said Michael Ellis, 54, a sweet-grass basketmaker who had come to the City Market every day since the shootings to sell his delicate wares at his regular table. “It’s good to see all of the people out here. To stay home — that’s not going to help anybody.”Mr. Ellis, 54, an African-American native of South Carolina’s Lowcountry, learned the art of basket weaving from his Gullah grandmother and mother. It is the region’s signature craft, the baskets a physical connection to the African roots that have defined this region for centuries, although, Mr. Ellis notes, many African-Americans over the years have moved out of the expensive historic downtown peninsula and into the outlying areas.Mr. Ellis said he was sickened by the shooting, and by the fact that some South Carolina whites still harbored the racist sentiments that the suspected shooter — Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white man — espoused half a century after the storied gains of the civil rights movement.But still, he said, he came to work.“I’m sure a lot of the people walking around here are concerned, that they’re thinking about it,” he said as a slow-moving river of tourists, most of them white, sauntered by in deck shoes and sandals on Saturday morning. “It’s like me — I’m here, but it’s still on my mind.”
