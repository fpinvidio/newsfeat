The German industrial giant Bayer has finally revealed its $62 billion takeover bid for Monsanto as it seeks to create a new titan in the world of farming.But so far, the chemical maker’s ambitious announcement — it is the largest takeover bid by a German company and the biggest all-cash acquisition offer on record — appears to have fallen on deaf ears.Monsanto, based in St. Louis, is the world’s biggest manufacturer of genetically modified crop seeds. Bayer is hoping to unite that business with its own pesticide operations, forming a one-stop shop for farmers. The combined company, with $67 billion in sales, would produce an array of products including pain medication, G.M.O. seeds and pesticides.It is an outsize takeover bid that requires the German company to win over antitrust regulators who may be leery of a huge new titan in the agricultural business. But more important, Bayer needs to win over skeptical investors.
