PhotoNEW YORK — Commenting upon the report that Federal agents were compiling a list of “gloaters”— i.e., Teuton sympathizers who exhibit satisfaction at reverses suffered by the Allies and the sinking of American ships — the “New Yorker Staats-Zeitung” says: “It has already been admitted that there exists no law under which such ‘gloaters’ — those rejoicing maliciously — may be punished.“But what does not ex­ist now may come. Therefore, the warn­ing that he who, as an American, re­joices at the enemy’s victories — and Ger­many certainly is an enemy — or mali­ciously discusses possible misfortunes of the United States, displays the lack of loyalty that is liable to punishment.“As for the ‘enemy aliens,’ however, who make merry over America’s under­takings, who praise Hindenburg as if he were not America’s arch-enemy, they will be interned — the warning is plain enough. So in the future don’t laugh, do not even grin; not only hold your tongue, but also close your lips.”—Ex­change Telegraph Company. — The New York Herald, European Edition, May 28, 1917
