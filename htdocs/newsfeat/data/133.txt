Peppery, crisp arugula stands up nicely to the punch of this garlicky, anchovy-filled dressing. You can adjust the dressingâ€™s pungency by adding more or fewer anchovies. The dressing will keep for a few days in the fridge, but the oil will solidify, so remember to take it out at least an hour before serving, and shake it really well.Featured in: Melissa Clark's Thanksgiving.
