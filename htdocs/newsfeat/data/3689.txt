WASHINGTON — Congress returns this week to finish the last of its business before a new year and era begin in Washington. Ebullient Republicans are eager to put some remaining legislation behind them and to try to fund the government through the rest of the year. Here are some areas to watch.21st-Century CuresThis legislation, which would finance increases in medical research and changes in regulations, is a priority for both the White House and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. President Obama would like a bipartisan postelection accomplishment, and many in his party would like to give it to him, especially since the bill addresses the cancer moonshot associated with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose son died of a brain tumor.“The president’s interested in the precision medicine part of that, the vice president is interested in the cancer moonshot part of it, I’m interested in the regenerative medicine part of it,” Mr. McConnell said last week. “I’d like to see us finish that important new measure this year.”The MilitaryCongress could pass a final version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act, an expansive military policy bill. There are a few contentious issues at play. The House version of the bill has a religious exemption provision for people seeking federal contracts that many Senate Democrats viewed as government-sponsored discrimination. The bill contains a provision that would permit religiously affiliated federal contractors to refuse to interview a job candidate whose faith differs from theirs. The Senate version had a provision that would for the first time require young women to register for the draft, something the House rejected. These differences must be reconciled.
