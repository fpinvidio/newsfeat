ALBANY — A Cuomo administration official on Wednesday urged a state commission considering whether to increase the pay of New York judges to exercise restraint and “consider the state’s fiscal outlook.”The testimony by the official, the state budget director, Robert L. Megna, represented the first clear signal to the commission of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s position. It is the latest development in a debate over judicial salaries that has lasted years and has been dominated by judges who argue they have been treated unfairly in a 12-year pay freeze.“We’re still in a very weak fiscal condition in the State of New York,” Mr. Megna said.The seven-member commission was created under a law passed last year because the Legislature has failed to approve a pay raise for judges since 1999. Its members were appointed by the governor, legislative leaders and the state’s chief judge.On Wednesday in a hearing room here, as they have for years, lawyers and judges made the case that experienced judges were leaving and qualified lawyers were unwilling to become judges because of the salary. Justices of the state’s highest-level trial court, the State Supreme Court, earn $136,700.

Some judges’ organizations have noted bitterly, for example, that because salaries for judges have not risen in years some courthouse employees earn more than they do.
