This stir-fry has hot (red pepper flakes), sour (vinegar), sweet (honey) and bitter (escarole) elements. Escarole goes by a few names, including broad-leafed endive and Batavia endive. (In France it is just called Batavia). It tastes a lot like curly endive, though not quite as bitter. It looks a bit like a ruffled leaf lettuce, with tougher leaves. The inner leaves are lighter and more tender than the outer leaves, and they are great in salads. I add them later than the outer leaves to this stir-fry.Featured in: The Pleasure Of Bitter Greens.
