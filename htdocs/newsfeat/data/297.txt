IMPROBABLY, in Romania, in the somewhat drab Black Sea city of Constanta, the owners of the pizzeria where we stopped for a snack and some wine had New York connections. It was all very convivial. But what really got my attention was something listed on the menu as Macedonian cheese pie. Imagine pizza-size calzone filled with feta.I made it not long after I returned from that trip. Later, I made it again, with the addition of some strips of sweet roasted peppers. It was even better, and hit its stride with some French sparkling wines that had modest effervescence, pleasant fruitiness and bright acidity.Next time, I might sprinkle chili flakes on the cheese, or smear some of that Balkan chili and pepper condiment, ajvar, on the dough before adding the cheese. No “might” about it. I will use the ajvar next time.Featured in: More Than One Part Of France Is Fizzy.
