The new standards will also be applied to neighboring provinces that have suffered from severe air pollution, Xinhua reported.Ma Jun, a prominent environmental researcher in Beijing, said the change highlighted officials’ worries about the social disruption a red alert could cause. With the new standards, he said, officials must reassess some of the contingency measures that come with the warning.“There will be multiple times of red alerts in a year if we continue using the current standards, which will bring about a high social and economic cost,” Mr. Ma said, alluding to the contingency measures. They include the closing of factories and schools and strict limits on the use of cars.Among the issues at stake is children’s health, he said, arguing for the need to re-evaluate the emergency measures after the imposition of the new standards. The Xinhua report said the response measures would remain the same, but each city affected would be able to decide if primary and middle schools should be temporarily closed.Mr. Ma argued that schools should continue to be closed even if Beijing declared a lower warning.Next week, the Chinese Communist Party will convene its Parliament, where air pollution is expected to be a major topic.The Chinese news media reported over the weekend that Beijing was considering a plan to build five ventilation corridors to improve urban air circulation. The corridors, each at least 1,500 feet wide, would run through the city, passing through parks, inner-city lakes and public spaces. Also being planned, the reports said, are an unspecified number of narrower corridors. It is not clear how much the project would cost or when it would be finished.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It said the root cause of the smog in Beijing was declining wind power, which it said was the result of an increased planting of trees where none had been before, lower atmospheric pressure and desertification in Inner Mongolia, a province north of Beijing.“We couldn’t help asking, did we plant the trees in the wrong place?” the article said. It also attacked the widely held view that smog comes from automobile exhaust, coal burning and industrial emissions, labeling such beliefs “ridiculous.”Liu Shuhua, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Peking University, expressed doubts about the ventilation corridors.“The weak vertical atmospheric circulation means ventilation corridors will have a very limited role to play,” he said. “They will only improve ground ventilation.”More studies need to be undertaken to back up Beijing’s plan to build ventilation corridors, and many details are still lacking, said Edward Ng, a professor at the School of Architecture of the Chinese University of Hong Kong who helped design ventilation corridors in Hong Kong.“Beijing has very low ground wind,” he said, meaning that the corridors would not be effective to disperse smog. He said that reducing industrial emissions remained crucial to tackling the issue.But, he said, many Chinese cities are hoping to join Beijing in the development of such tools. He said he would be in Xi’an, the capital of the northwestern province of Shaanxi, this week to discuss a plan to build ventilation corridors with officials there.
