Ideally, the chicken should be cut as follows: Two legs, two thighs. Have the breast cut lengthwise in half. Leave the main wing bone attached to each breast half. Cut each breast half crosswise into two pieces of more or less equal size. Reserve the extraneous pieces (backbone, neck, etc.) for another use such as stock.
