Things are finally looking up for Citi Bike, New York City’s well-loved-but-wobbly bicycle-sharing program, which has been pedaling toward oblivion almost since the day it began.A major reboot, announced on Tuesday by Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, seeks to make Citi Bike far bigger — and, most importantly, self-sufficient — by giving its troubled operator, Alta Bicycle Share, a big infusion of private capital and reorganizing it under new leadership. The new chief executive, Jay Walder, who once managed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, is a highly respected and seasoned transit expert; his involvement is one good sign that this plan may actually work.Mr. Walder’s job is to make Citi Bike grow, not just as a tourist novelty but as a vital part of the city’s transportation web. Plagued by delays, hurricane damage, maintenance problems and glitchy software, Citi Bike has never reached its promised scale. It now has 330 docking stations and 6,000 bikes, which is hardly adequate.The new plan is to have more than 12,000 bikes and 700 docking stations by 2017 and to expand above 59th Street into Harlem; cover a bigger stretch of Brooklyn, including Red Hook and Bushwick; and finally cross into Queens, in Astoria and Long Island City.
