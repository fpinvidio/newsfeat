The word “sage” is derived from the Latin word salvia, which means “safe, whole, healthy.” In ancient times, sage was viewed as a medical cure-all, at once a diuretic, an antiseptic and a tonic for digestive disorders, liver trouble and headaches; small wonder the plant maintained a premier spot in the herbal apothecary throughout the Middle Ages.Of solid character and haunting flavor, sage does better with robust, earthy peasant fare rather than with more refined cuisine. It pairs perfectly here with potatoes and stands up well to garlic. Enjoy with your favorite roasted or grilled meat.Featured in: Food; Sage Advice.Learn: How to Cook Potatoes
