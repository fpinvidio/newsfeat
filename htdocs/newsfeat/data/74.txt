bemoan • \bi-ˈmōn, bē-\ • verb: regret stronglyThe word bemoan has appeared in 22 Times articles over the past year, most recently in an article about pro basketball, “In Its 30th Year in N.B.A., 3-Pointer Is No Outsider” , on October 17, 2009:…Some purists bemoan the lost art of the midrange jump shot, a sign that fundamentals are being extinguished beneath a mix tape of long shots and slam dunks. As the N.B.A. slowly turns toward more analytical measures, the 3-pointer is viewed under a new prism. The most ideal shot, Nets Coach Lawrence Frank said, is from the free-throw line because it almost always results in at least a point. The next-highest-percentage shot is at the rim. Three-pointers are next. But a team would have to shoot 60 percent on 2-pointers to match the offensive output of a team that shoots 40 percent from beyond the arc.
