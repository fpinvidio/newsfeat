The Senate and the House closed in on a final version of the tax bill on Friday, as Republican leaders stay on track for final votes on the consensus bill next week.Some tempting planning opportunities might come to fruition next year, but tax advisers suggest that people resist until the bill becomes law. Why wait? Because taxpayers will be no worse off than they are today, and could be better off if a new tax code is enacted.Last week, I wrote about the tax strategies that affluent people might want to undertake before the end of the year. These included paying property taxes and state taxes early for taxpayers who have not set off the alternative minimum tax, making large charitable gifts or filling a donor-advised fund, and harvesting stock losses because of a potential tax change about how different blocks of stock can be sold.This week, I look at the strategies that could be important next year if the tax overhaul shakes out the way advisers believe it will.
