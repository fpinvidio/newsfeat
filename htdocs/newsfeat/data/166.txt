In this simple recipe, raw pasta and cherry tomatoes are simmered together in a single pan, cooking the pasta and forming a thick, starchy sauce at the same time.

When you season and top with cheese, you could add a pile of fresh chopped herbs, like mint, basil or oregano.Featured in: Review: Practical Magic For The Modern Cook.
