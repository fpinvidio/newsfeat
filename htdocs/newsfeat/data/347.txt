This is an Iraqi dish for Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, with bitter Swiss chard, sweet beets and beef in a sweet and sour sauce. In Amara, a city near Basra in southern Iraq, the dish is called "mahshi" or "stuffed" in Arabic. It is traditionally made by stuffing Swiss chard leaves with beets, onions and sometimes meat. This version is called false mahshi, as the dish is made in layers.Featured in: Sweet, Sour, Tasty: An Old Iraq New Year.
