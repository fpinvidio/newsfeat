Even a pep talk from the chief executive of Apple, the single biggest American company by market value, did little to soothe investors on Monday.As the Chinese stock market slump ignited fear around the world, Apple’s chief, Timothy D. Cook, broadcast to Wall Street that the tech giant’s business in China was just fine, thank you. His corporate cheerleading wasn’t just unusual because of its message, but also because of his delivery method, an email to a financial television host.It worked — for a time. But by the end of the day, Apple and the rest of the market had yielded to the gravitational pull of investor fear.While Apple’s 2.5 percent loss was milder than the overall market’s plunge, Mr. Cook is fighting the same forces as ordinary investors and financial professionals. On some days, market psychology — and the tendency for panicked sell-offs to feed on themselves — counts for more than long-term fundamentals like growing iPhone sales in China or strong earnings results.
