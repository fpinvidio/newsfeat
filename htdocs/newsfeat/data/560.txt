Vichy carrots are a dish in which the vegetables are cooked through in water with a little sugar on them to create a glaze. Historically, the excellence of this preparation derived from the quality of the spring water in Vichy, a resort town in central France. Jody Williams, the chef at Buvette in Greenwich Village, from whom this recipe is adapted, adds sherry vinegar to the water, along with, eventually, some honey, shallots and a pinch or two of fresh thyme. Who knows if the Vichyssoise would recognize the result. But served hot, room temperature or cold, they are some fantastic carrots.Featured in: Courtly Meals From Buvetteâ€™s Queen.
