Above, from left: Y peeler, bar spoon, mixing glass, julep strainer, muddler, jiggers, Boston shaker and Hawthorne strainer.A Boston shaker, which consists of a mixing glass (the same shape and size as a 16-ounce Shaker pint glass) and a metal tin, is sufficient for all shaken and stirred cocktails. For stirred drinks, you’ll need a long-handled bar spoon. If you enjoy the ritual of stirring a cocktail, and want to feel slightly grand as you do so, there are a number of lovely, wide-mouthed, heavy-bottomed mixing glasses on the market.To strain stirred drinks you’ll need a julep strainer, which has a perforated bowl shape. Shaken drinks require a Hawthorne strainer, which has a metal coil wrapped around its bowl to keep out citrus pulp. If you’d rather invest in only one strainer, the Hawthorne can do double duty.Precise measurements produce a far better drink, so you’ll need a jigger. Jiggers are composed of two opposing metal cones. Unless you are a stickler, you really only need one size, the ½ ounce/1 ounce, with which you’ll have all the most common measurements covered. You can eyeball the rest.A simple Y peeler will work for citrus twists. Completing your toolkit should be a muddler, which is used to mash up the fruits, herbs and sometimes sugar cubes used in some drinks. Old-fashioned wooden specimens work best.Many on-the-rocks drinks, such as the Old-Fashioned, benefit from large-scale ice cubes. Molds for these (usually about 2 x 2 inches) have become increasingly easy to find.
