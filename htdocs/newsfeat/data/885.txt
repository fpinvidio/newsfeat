Late Saturday morning, much of the block was still cordoned off and at least a dozen evidence markers were on the ground where shell casings had been found.One man, who would not provide his name, said he was at a gas station on Third Avenue when he heard several gunshots. He said he rushed around the corner and saw the man who had been fatally shot lying near the curb, bleeding from a head wound.Luis Martinez, 26, who lives on Fourth Avenue between Butler and Douglas Streets, said he was awakened by gunshots. He said he looked through a window and saw three men outside of a sandwich shop on the southeast corner of Butler Street and Fourth Avenue, and two others on the northeast corner.Mr. Martinez said he saw sparks fly through the air as one of the men on the northeast corner fired a weapon at the group on the other corner.One of the men outside the sandwich shop fell to the ground, Mr. Martinez said, and a dark stain spread across the manâ€™s white shirt.Then, he said, the men standing on the northeast corner fled.
