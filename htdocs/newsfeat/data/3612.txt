The first time I saw splatter-painted floor was inside a simple shingled house atop a windswept dune on Nantucket. We lived there as a family only briefly, but my memory of the design is vivid. The wooden planks in the old-fashioned kitchen with its swinging door to the backyard were wide and knotty; they had been lacquered a stormy gray and dribbled with specks of turquoise, pale yellow and poppy red. Standing on those floors, we grilled blueberry muffins with butter in a cast-iron pan in the mornings; on our knees, we raced lobsters before they were tossed into a pot in the evenings. I ran the bottoms of my sunburned feet along the raised pattern of the splatter, imagining the aftermath of a rainbow-colored rainstorm or the detritus of a birthday piñata. It seemed as magical as the scallop shells I painted with glitter nail polish each day after the beach.I’ve encountered very few splatter jobs since, always in no-nonsense summer bungalows in Massachusetts. Often referred to as “spatter-dashing,” the style appears to have originated in, and largely remained confined to, the rugged, unforgiving coast of Cape Cod. And to that almost-extinct, supremely special variety of summer cottage that remains unchanged from one season to the next, reassuring in its humble mustiness, impervious to trends and, most magically, time.
