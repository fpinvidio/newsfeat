No one, it seems, is safe from food contamination, not even fans of D’Artagnan’s elite duck products, which include many chefs and well-heeled consumers. A Long Island firm has issued a recall on six-leg packs of D’Artagnan duck confit on suspicion of Listeria contamination. The packages affected by the recall are stamped with a “use or freeze by” date of “08/07/09″ and carry the number “P-5374″ inside the USDA mark of inspection. The packages were sent to distributors and restaurants from Maryland to Massachusetts.
