In this fast, piquant weeknight meal, ground pork and green beans are stir-fried with plenty of ginger, garlic and chiles, and seasoned with soy sauce and coriander seeds. A big splash of rice-wine vinegar right at the end adds a hit of acidity, which balances the pork's richness. Serve this over rice or rice noodles to help absorb all the salty, spicy sauce. Slices of fresh tomato add a sweet juiciness that works well here. But if you don't have a ripe tomato, feel free to leave it out.Featured in: A Stir Fry That Brings Out The Best In Green Beans.
