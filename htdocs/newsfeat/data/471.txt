What's not to love about a juicy plum filling surrounded by plenty of buttery streusel? In this simple recipe, you have to cook down the plums to be thick enough, but the process is relatively hands off, and the flavor of the slow-simmered fruit is well worth it. You can cut the cobbler easily into bars, as the name implies, but the filling stays a bit soft, so you may prefer to eat them with a fork. They're excellent with ice cream, but many like them best topped with a drizzle of cold heavy cream.
