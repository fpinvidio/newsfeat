The transfers were apparently discovered after the French authorities began a criminal investigation last year of the elder Mr. Diack — who was also a member of the International Olympic Committee until 2013 — on suspicion of having accepted more than $1 million in bribes to cover up positive drug tests.A World Anti-Doping Agency report in January found that Black Tidings was implicated in the drug testing cover-up.Mr. Takeda had previously acknowledged that payments were made, but he said they were audited and were for legitimate purposes. He declined to answer further questions from lawmakers on Wednesday, citing a confidentiality agreement with Black Tidings.News of the French investigation was first revealed by The Guardian on May 11. The French authorities are also investigating the awarding of the 2016 Summer Games to Rio de Janeiro.The Japanese Olympic Committee could not be reached after working hours on Wednesday.
