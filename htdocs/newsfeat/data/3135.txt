Here’s a look at the most memorable moments from the Oscars on Sunday, starting, of course, with the mistake people will be talking about for years to come.The Best and Worst Mixup in Oscar HistoryUh, “La La Land” actually did not win best picture. That’s a screw-up for the ages for sure, but in terms of awards-show-as-entertainment, perhaps the greatest highlight of all time. Presenting the award, Warren Beatty somehow wound up with the wrong envelope — the one announcing Emma Stone’s best actress win — and he handed it off to Faye Dunaway, who quickly named the movie Emma Stone starred in, “La La Land,” as the winner. The whole “La La Land” team rushed the stage, giving the requisite effusive speeches. Whoops! “Moonlight” actually won, though some of the glow of their special moment was lost in the confusion and disbelief on stage.— Margaret LyonsRead what it was like onstage during the mixup.
