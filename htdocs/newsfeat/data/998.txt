Read in Chinese | 点击查看本文中文版Posters for a new Chinese movie on the Cairo Declaration, the 1943 statement by Allied leaders that laid out the goal of defeating Japan and liberating the territories it occupied, have touched off online ridicule because they feature a man who wasn’t even there.The man, if the actor’s resemblance is a little lacking, is supposed to be Mao Zedong, the founder of the People’s Republic of China. At the time of the Cairo Conference, he was leading Communist forces from territory they occupied in western China. While his forces contributed to the war against Japan, historians say it was Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists who did most of the fighting and dying. Chiang represented the Republic of China at the Cairo Conference, which Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill also attended.“We can’t say that Mao had nothing to do with the meeting because the Communist Party of China led by Mao at that time had already become an important force” against the Japanese military during the war, Sima Pingbang, a Chinese writer, told Global Times, a newspaper run by the Communist Party.“However, by featuring Mao, who was not present at the meeting, but excluding Chiang, the poster shows no respect for history nor to Mao,” Mr. Sima said.The film is produced by the August First Film Studio, which is run by the People’s Liberation Army. Its release is scheduled to coincide with events commemorating the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in Asia. The posters have prompted an onslaught of mashups that feature alternative participants in the Cairo Conference.They include the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un:President Xi Jinping of China:The 1989 Tiananmen protest leader Wang Dan:The Japanese pornography star Anri Okita:Some cats:A trailer for ‘‘Cairo Declaration’’ also begins with Mao and shows him four times over less than two minutes, though it also makes clear that Chiang represented China in Cairo.Follow Austin Ramzy on Twitter @austinramzy.
