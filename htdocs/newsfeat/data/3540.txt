Humans have probably been pondering the flight of birds as long as there have been humans. And in the age of science, it would seem that every aspect of flight had been studied in order to build flying machines, from passenger airplanes to tiny robots.But, said David Lentink, a Stanford University engineer, researchers had “never measured the aerodynamic force directly of any flying animal.” Dr. Lentink and two colleagues reported last month in the journal Interface that they had solved the problem.Scientists had found other ways to measure that force indirectly — by observing air flow, for example, and going through some complex calculations.Dr. Lentink built a box big enough for a bird called a parrotlet to fly from one perch to another. It was equipped with high-speed video recorders and sensors to weigh the box every millisecond.
