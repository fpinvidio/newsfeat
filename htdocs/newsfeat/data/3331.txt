The foreign ministers of Guatemala and Venezuela conferred in New York but were unable to break the stalemate over which Latin American country should join the Security Council next year. Diplomats had hoped the meeting would produce an agreement on a compromise candidate. No additional talks between the ministers were planned. The General Assembly will resume voting on Tuesday on who should occupy the seat.
