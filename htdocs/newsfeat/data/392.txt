Savory pies and tarts are go-to dishes at Thanksgiving. They can be made well in advance and they make a great main course for guests who are not eating turkey.We chose this recipe from Kathy Patalsky, a vegan blogger in Los Angeles, to represent the savory pie in our Vegetarian Thanksgiving series. We liked that it was easy (she suggests a pre-made crust) and the hazelnuts make it a great option for the winter holidays as well.“These flavors are rustic, filling, cozy and festive,” Ms. Patalsky wrote. “I adore pot pies and tarts for main dish entrees. You can easily slice them like pies and serve to guests in an elegant way."Featured in: Vegetarian Thanksgiving: Easy Mushroom Hazelnut Tart.
