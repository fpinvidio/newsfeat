This recipe appeared in The Times in an article titled “Women Here and There — Their Frills and Fancies” in 1900. It's not meant for salads, but for summer drinks like shrubs. You may halve or quarter the recipe.Use any kind of vinegar you like, and feel free to switch up the berries. If cloudberries are all you have, so be it. You’re also supposed to macerate the berries and vinegar for three days. If you do it for just a day, it will still taste delicious.Featured in: Raspberry Vinegar: 1900.
