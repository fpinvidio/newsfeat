PYONGYANG, North Korea — Towering apartment blocks line the gleaming, six-lane avenue known as Future Scientists Street, their boldly colored facades leaping from the drab hues that dominate the rest of Pyongyang’s skyline.At street level, there are electronics stores, a movie theater and a new pizzeria, where visitors are welcomed by young waitresses in bright red uniforms.A pizza costs about $8, and a pasta entree less than half that. There is a bright aquarium near the entrance, but it is devoid of life — much like the restaurant, which was eerily quiet the night I visited.The restaurant is Italy Pizza, hailed by local guides as the hottest new dining spot in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. It serves up a taste of cosmopolitan savvy for the city’s elite — and proof to foreign visitors that all is well in the nation despite punishing economic sanctions, international isolation and intermittent reports of deprivation and famine.
