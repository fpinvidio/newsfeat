Two reports this week offered more details about what they described as a sexual relationship between Donald J. Trump and Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic-film actress who was reportedly paid $130,000 in hush money shortly before the 2016 election.In Touch magazine published excerpts on Wednesday from its 2011 interview with Ms. Clifford, 38, known as Stormy Daniels. In them, she said she had had an affair with Mr. Trump that started in 2006 and continued on and off for a few years.A Slate article published on Tuesday by Jacob Weisberg, editor in chief of the Slate Group, expanded on what he told The New York Times on Friday. Slate detailed his communications with Ms. Clifford from August to October 2016. Her account is similar to that published by In Touch.Ms. Clifford told Mr. Weisberg that her lawyer Keith Davidson, who has represented a number of pornographic-film stars and models, had negotiated the $130,000 deal with Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trumpâ€™s lawyer. Mr. Weisberg said that she was sharing these details because Mr. Trump had not yet paid her or finalized the confidentiality agreement. The Wall Street Journal published an article on Friday reporting that the payment had been made.
