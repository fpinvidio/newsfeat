Winter squash is a nutrient-dense vegetable, with lots of vitamin A in the form of beta carotene (the more orange the flesh, generally the more vitamin A in the squash), vitamin C, potassium and dietary fiber. Winter squash goes well with ginger, and this stir-fry makes a delicious vegetarian main course. Use a sweet, dense squash like butternut for this dish.Featured in: New Ideas For Winter Squash.
