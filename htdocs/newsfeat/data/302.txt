Advance preparation: The broth can be made several hours before you wish to cook the risotto. You can make the risotto halfway through step 3 several hours ahead. Spread out in the pan in a thin layer, and allow to cool. Shortly before serving, add a ladleful of stock to the rice, bring back to a simmer and proceed with the recipe.
