When there is no electrical outlet nearby or you want to bring light into a dark landscape, having a portable, rechargeable lamp comes in handy.“The beauty of rechargeable lanterns is that we can put them into places where we don’t have power,” said Nathan Orsman, a lighting designer based in New York City and Southampton. “Near water and pools, or outdoor dining areas where we can’t pull a wire to do something more permanent.”They are especially ideal for outdoor parties, Mr. Orsman said, because they can be used to temporarily illuminate stairs and tables. But they are also useful indoors, as bedside lamps that can light the path to the bathroom or the kitchen in the middle of the night.In recent years, Mr. Orsman said, “the technology has become so much better,” with lamps that provide a more pleasing color of light, brighter output and better battery life.
