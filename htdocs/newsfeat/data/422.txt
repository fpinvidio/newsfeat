White port with tonic is a common drink throughout Portugal. The light-bodied and fruity wine pairs well with the bitterness of tonic, creating a happy, easygoing drink. A 1-to-2 ratio works best here; you donâ€™t want to use too much tonic or the gentle flavors of the port will be overwhelmed. Choice of tonic is a matter of preference. Canada Dry makes for a livelier mix, but the lighter Q Tonic leads to a more elegant drink. La Taberna in Napa, Calif., tops the drink with a lime wedge, but I find a lemon a more harmonious companion.Featured in: Beyond Gin And Tonic.
