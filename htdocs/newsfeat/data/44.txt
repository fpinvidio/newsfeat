He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923. “To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Nothing” appeared in Poetry magazine nine years earlier.— Poetry FoundationTo a Friend Whose Work Has Come to NothingBy William Butler YeatsNow all the truth is out,Be secret and take defeatFrom any brazen throat,For how can you compete,Being honor bred, with oneWho were it proved he liesWere neither shamed in his ownNor in his neighbors’ eyes;Bred to a harder thingThan Triumph, turn awayAnd like a laughing stringWhereon mad fingers playAmid a place of stone,Be secret and exult,Because of all things knownThat is most difficult.Times Selection ExcerptIn his article “Novelist and His Hero Wonder, Will It Last?” Christopher Kelly describes his work by referring to the Yeats poem we’ve published above:To research his latest work of historical fiction, the post-World War I novel “Remember Ben Clayton,” the novelist and screenwriter Stephen Harrigan traveled to France twice so he could faithfully describe the town of Saint-Étienne and the battle that took place there in 1918. In Austin, where he lives, he spent hours poring over newspaper microfiche so he could write about what movies were playing at the time and what brands of chewing gum were being advertised. For the novel’s central character, however, Mr. Harrigan did not need to dig as deeply into history. In writing about an aging yet still madly ambitious sculptor named Francis (Gil) Gilheaney, the 62-year-old Mr. Harrigan drew upon his own joys and frustrations as a Texas artist who has never been in fashion among the New York literary set, and who wonders if any of his work will still be read after he is gone. “I’ve always been taken by the Yeats poem ‘To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Nothing,’ ” Mr. Harrigan said. “I remember coming across that poem in college and thinking, ‘Oh, man, what a dire fate.’ And yet, every creative person wrestles with it. Has this been worth it? Am I going to be remembered?” “Remember Ben Clayton” begins with Gil helplessly trying to protect one of his finest public sculptures from being destroyed by rioters in Oklahoma.William Butler Yeats’s “To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Nothing” is from Poetry (May 1914).
