With farm-fresh asparagus, no cooking is needed. If the stalks are fat, slice them lengthwise with a simple kitchen peeler; if theyâ€™re skinny, just chop everything up fine. Add radishes, fresh herbs, pea tendrils (if available), toasted pumpkin seeds, and you have an easy, incredibly vibrant salad. Add Parmesan or cut-up hard-boiled eggs if you like. Finish with olive oil and lemon juice.Featured in: Visiting The Source | A Chef In The Field: Asparagus.Learn: How to Make SaladLearn: How to Cook Asparagus
