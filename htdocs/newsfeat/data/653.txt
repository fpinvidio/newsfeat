This portable recipe was created by Kathy Patalsky, of Los Angeles. Ms. Patalsky came up with the recipe in college to bring to a family feast.“Since I love Thanksgiving, I didn’t want to miss out on any of my favorite dishes,” she said. “So instead of bringing multiple dishes and crowding the already crowded dinner table, I made these little gems. I wanted my entire vegan Thanksgiving meal stuffed inside a puffy pita pocket.”Featured in: Vegetarian Thanksgiving — Sweet Potato Pockets.
