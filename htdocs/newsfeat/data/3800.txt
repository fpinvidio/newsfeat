During the performance, Busta Rhymes called out the president explicitly: “I just want to thank President Agent Orange for perpetuating all of the evil that you’ve been perpetuating throughout the United States,” he said. “I want to thank President Agent Orange for your unsuccessful attempt of the Muslim ban. When we come together, we the people, we the people, we the people, we the people...”Q-Tip ended the performance with one word, repeated several times: “Resist. Resist. Resist. Resist.”The earlier nods to the divisive political climate had been much gentler. Presenting the first award of the night, Jennifer Lopez quoted Toni Morrison. Alicia Keys sent a single-word tweet (“EQUALITY.”), in reference to a new Nike ad.
