This dish from Yotam Ottolenghi, a chef and an author of "Jerusalem," the beloved Middle Eastern cookbook, takes inspiration from a city where fig trees grow in abundance. Roasted sweet potatoes, along with wedges of fresh figs, are piled onto a plate, drizzled with a green onion-chile sauce and a balsamic reduction then dotted with generous pats of goat cheese. Do plan ahead, as this recipe does require a bit of preparation, but it's easy work that's more than worth it.Featured in: Thanksgiving From Jerusalem.
