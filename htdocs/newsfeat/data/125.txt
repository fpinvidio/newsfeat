This spicy North African condiment has many versions, but usually contains dried hot red pepper, caraway, cumin and garlic. Just a small dab packs quite a punch, and can be used to brighten soups, sauces or marinades. Thinned with olive oil, itâ€™s good drizzled over grilled meat or vegetables. Store it in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.Featured in: Lamb, Slow Roasted The Moroccan Way, Without The Barbecue Spit.
