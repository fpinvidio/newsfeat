It says everything you need to know about Eric Gonzalez’s abrupt ascension to the post of acting district attorney for Brooklyn that when he was recently honored by a local public high school, the award he received was still emblazoned with his predecessor’s name.Mr. Gonzalez had made a brief appearance in a balloon-festooned gymnasium to receive the prize, which had been meant for his boss: Ken Thompson, the former district attorney whose death last month from cancer, at age 50, shocked the city. While the school had managed to add Mr. Gonzalez to the program, there had been no time to re-engrave the little crystal statue.Mr. Gonzalez graciously accepted it. He then turned to address a crowd of students who, like many in the borough, had no idea who he was. “I wish Ken were here for this,” he said. “But you should know that he believed that the criminal-justice system needed to be changed because so much of it comes down on young people like you.”It has been a disconcerting time for Mr. Gonzalez, who since mid-October has struggled both to console his grieving staff and to find his own voice in the chorus of mournful praise for Mr. Thompson, a man whom he not only served as a second-in-command, but also considered a friend and mentor. Virtually unknown before October, Mr. Gonzalez has also been thrust into a rapidly approaching political campaign: one that he has chosen to approach, as he did with that award last week, by embracing the Thompson name.
