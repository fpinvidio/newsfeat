Prosecutors also sought any notification letters and lead-based-paint evaluation results regarding the relevant people, properties and incidents. They also sought documents reflecting complaints about health conditions in public housing and homeless shelters, including those about “leaks, water damage, mold, particulate matter peeling paint in pre-1978 buildings, lead paint, rodents or insects, and all documents reflecting any response to, investigation of or evaluation of such complaints” by any city or state official or agency.The initial demand also sought all communications between the city’s health, homeless and housing agencies, or any city, state or federal agency, about problematic health conditions in city public housing or homeless shelters. Prosecutors also sought documents reflecting any city or state analysis of the health effects of lead, mold, particulate matter, rodents or insects on residents of city public housing or homeless shelters.Asked about the investigation on Wednesday night, during an appearance at a panel discussion at Cooper Union titled “The Next 100 Years of Affordable Housing,” the Housing Authority chairwoman and chief executive, Shola Olatoye, said she had no comment. Referring to herself and Mayor Bill de Blasio, she said, “What we all care about is having a safe and healthy community.”The public housing stock of red brick towers dates as far back as the 1930s and 1940s — with many still likely to contain lead paint — and the agency has struggled to keep up with a backlog of work orders, including for lead paint removal.This month, State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester County, and Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from the Bronx who is chairman of the City Council’s Public Housing Committee, released the results of a door-to-door survey their offices conducted among more than 200 Nycha residents, with 63 percent of those surveyed reporting something damaged or broken in their unit.The officials said staff members took pictures in common areas of “egregious” violations, like electrical wiring, mold and peeling paint.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has committed $300 million over three years for roof repairs, which officials said would help deal with the root cause of mold and excessive moisture.
