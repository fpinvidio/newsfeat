Itâ€™s not that David Chang, the chef and owner of the Momofuku Noodle Bar in the East Village, doesn't like vegetables. In fact he loves them. He just thinks a little meat makes them better.Even his fish gets the meat treatment. When you look at Mr. Chang's razor clams with kielbasa, you see a dish that, with a couple of exceptions, like the addition of soy and ginger, could have originated in Portugal. Of course that country's cuisine has as much respect for the tradition of including meat in nearly everything as Mr. Chang's own.Featured in: The Chef: David Chang; Fish And Vegetables, Cozying Up To Meat.
