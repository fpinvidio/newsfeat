For more than two decades, all manner of chokeholds have been banned by the New York Police Department. Recruits learn not to use them in the academy; officers are periodically reminded of the ban in training materials.But despite its dangers, the maneuver can be effective in subduing a resisting person, and it has been tough to eliminate its use by officers.On Thursday, an officer gripped the neck of a Staten Island man resisting arrest for selling loose cigarettes, holding him with his arm as they fell to the ground. The man, Eric Garner, later died, prompting outrage and setting off a new round of scrutiny of the stubborn persistence of a banned practice.Mr. Garner’s case immediately brought to mind the last time the city focused on a man’s death after an officer’s chokehold. Then, as now, Commissioner William J. Bratton led the police. It was 1994, not long after the Police Department banned the use of chokeholds, and Anthony Baez was tossing a football with his brothers in the Bronx and struck a patrol car. Soon his neck was pinned in a police officer’s grip. According to the city’s chief medical examiner, Mr. Baez died of asphyxiation. (The medical examiner has not yet made a determination of the cause of death in Mr. Garner’s case.)
