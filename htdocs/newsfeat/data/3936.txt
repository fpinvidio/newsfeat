A GLASS of wine can have the madeleine effect for me, evoking a flood of memories. So it is with St.-Joseph.The first time I drank one was in 1977 at lunch at La Pyramide in Vienne, France. Mado Point, the widow of Fernand Point, the celebrated chef and La Pyramide's founder, was still running the restaurant.
