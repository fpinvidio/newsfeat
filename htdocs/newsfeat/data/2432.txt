Katie Uhlaender was a three-time United States Olympian when she competed at the Sochi Games in February 2014. She was seeking her first Olympic medal, and after four runs down an icy 1.1-mile skeleton course, she was sure she had succeeded.She had not. She placed fourth, finishing four-hundredths of a second behind Elena Nikitina of Russia, who took third.Two years later, after replaying the competition in her mind countless times, Ms. Uhlaender learned that Ms. Nikitina was among dozens of Russian athletes at the Sochi Games who were part of a government-run doping program, according to the longtime director of Russia’s antidoping lab, Grigory Rodchenkov.“My gut just got all wrenchy,” Ms. Uhlaender said recently, tears welling up as she slowed her pedaling on a stationary bike. “It’s opening a wound.”
