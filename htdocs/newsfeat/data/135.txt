It is rare that meatballs can be described as light, but these are. You bake them in the oven at a low temperature and the result is a very tender meatball. The mushroom base renders a flavor that is more vegetal than meaty. The recipe is easy to double and the meatballs freeze well. They are great to have on hand.Featured in: Cutting Down On The Meat, But Not The Taste.
