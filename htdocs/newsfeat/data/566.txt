There will be a day when the weather suddenly cools and my basil plants and those at your farmers’ market stop thriving, but that day hasn’t come yet. So I’m making lots of pesto and pistou (pesto without the nuts), putting some of it in the freezer (I just blend the basil and olive oil together for the freezer and add the other ingredients when I thaw the mixture) and using the rest in all manner of pastas. This is the first time I’ve used it in a lasagna.Featured in: Pasta Dishes With Vegetables As Stars.Learn: How to Make Pasta
