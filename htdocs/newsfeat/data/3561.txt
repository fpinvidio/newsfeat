BEIJING — Pop groups do not usually entertain audiences with songs like “Our Dear Leader!” and “Do Prosper, Era of the Workers’ Party.”Yet those may be among the ditties that North Korea’s Moranbong Band — two dozen or so slender young women in form-fitting outfits and high heels — perform in Beijing on Saturday night, in their first overseas appearance.Moranbong Band is the latest (and maybe the only) soft-power export from North Korea. It is the favorite group of Kim Jong-un, the nation’s young authoritarian leader, and some reports say he handpicked each member. Mr. Kim’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, who once sang in a band herself, is believed to be a patron.Moranbong has been dispatched to Beijing at a time when China and North Korea are trying to improve relations amid differences about the North’s nuclear ambitions and other economic and political matters.
