What happens when a newly minted gay icon kicks off the Oscars red carpet? Pure, unapologetic edge.Adam Rippon, 28, an Olympic figure skater who was the first out gay American man to qualify for the Winter Games, wore a black harness under his tuxedo to the normally buttoned-up event on Sunday night. He also wore a black bow tie and eschewed socks.The S&M-inspired look by Moschino immediately spurred support on social media once photos of the outfit hit the internet.“Somewhere in heaven, Oscar Wilde, Harvey Milk, James Baldwin, and Michelangelo just shared a margarita,” tweeted Chris Rovzar, of Bloomberg.
