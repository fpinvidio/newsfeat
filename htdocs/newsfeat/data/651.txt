In this versatile side dish, cauliflower is both saut√©ed (for flavor and tenderness) and left raw (for crunch), then dressed with warm, crushed olives and melted anchovies. The preserved lemon, which is optional, may seem like a bit much given all the other salty, briny ingredients, but its punch does a lot to bring everything together.
