Cheese balls lack such an illustrious and definitive past. Nut-crusted and filled with mysterious cheeses and bits of vegetable, cheese balls tend to be associated with shag rugs and tinsel, symbols of the middle-class middlebrow. Maybe they came before their time. Cream cheese and industrial Cheddar made for likable filler before a meal. But now, with so many interesting cheeses available, it's easy to see that a cheese ball doesn't have to be stodgy. This one, from Amanda Hesser, has hints of the Eastern Mediterranean. The cream cheese is mashed with goat cheese, then seasoned with cumin, coriander, lemon zest, celery hearts, mint and grated Pecorino Romano cheese. The ball is rolled in ground pistachios. For a Spanish-inspired version, try incorporating grated Manchego into the cream cheese, along with pimenton (Spanish red pepper), olives, scallion and Worcestershire sauce, then rolling it in ground almonds and smoked paprika.Featured in: If You Want It Delicious, Make It Yourself.
