Recommended reads from New York Times reporters and editors, highlighting great stories from around the web.The AtlanticMany great articles have been written lately on the state of black America in an age of growing inequality. Here is an illuminating piece that breaks out black America from the rest of the country. The findings, told in charts, were pretty astounding — black America lags 30 places in world rankings behind the rest of America in terms of well-being.
