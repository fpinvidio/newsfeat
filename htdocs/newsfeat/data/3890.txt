When Meg He moved to the Lower East Side from London last year, decorating her tiny rental apartment was the last thing on her mind.The clothing start-up that she had co-founded was just taking off, and setting up a new office in SoHo left little time to work on her new home, a one-bedroom just shy of 400 square feet.So she made do with a few pieces of furniture and put off figuring out what to do with her wardrobe and a wide assortment of equipment for her various interests. “There is an upright digital piano, three yoga mats and props,” she said, ticking off a long list of gear, including dance shoes, figure skates, an easel, paints and canvases, a violin, a pull-up bar, rock-climbing equipment and a dog crate for Forrest, her toy-size Australian shepherd. “I also have more than 20 plants, and some of them have names.”
