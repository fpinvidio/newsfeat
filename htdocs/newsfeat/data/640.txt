This simple vanilla Bundt cake has plenty of freshly grated nutmeg to nod to the flavor of old-fashioned doughnuts. But since it’s baked rather than fried, it also gets a generous coating of melted butter while it’s still warm to give it some of that doughnut richness. Then it’s coated in cinnamon-sugar. It’s neither a doughnut nor a cake – it’s both. It’s delicious right after it’s made, but it tastes even more like an old-fashioned doughnut after sitting overnight. Store it tightly wrapped in plastic wrap at room temperature for up to 4 days.
