As majority leader, Eric Cantor was charged with running the House and electing his Republican colleagues. The tension between the two caused him to schedule, and to vote for, some legislation that angered the conservative base.Since first being elected to the House in 2000, he has voted with a majority of his Republican colleagues 95 percent of the time or more in most Congresses. His lowest “party unity” score, as calculated by The Upshot, was 91.3 percent during the 110th Congress (2007-2008), when Democrats held the majority. But even then, he voted with his party about as often as Todd Akin, then a Missouri congressman, did.
