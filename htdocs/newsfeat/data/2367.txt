Why He Won'tMr. Cruz is hardly the only conservative seeking the Republican nomination, and he could be overmatched by rivals able to raise more money, to enjoy crossover support from more moderate Republicans, or both. Should he find himself the torch-bearer for the right, he would still find it difficult to defeat a better-funded Republican who had the backing of the party establishment. In a general election, Mr. Cruz would most likely struggle to appeal to centrist voters, and at the same time he could find himself unable to rouse the portion of the electorate that aligns with him ideologically but does not vote.
