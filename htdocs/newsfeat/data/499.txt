John Willoughby fell in love with pimentón, a smoky Spanish paprika, after a trip to La Vera, a region west of Madrid, first encountering it in a lamb stew.“The stew, rich with the slight gaminess of lamb, the tang of sherry and the smooth comfort of white beans, was brought to greatness by the subtle heat and almost mysterious smokiness of the pimentón,” he wrote.He drew inspiration from the stew, making his own version at home and bringing this recipe to The Times in 2010.Featured in: Pimentón: It’s Spanish For ‘Better Than Paprika’.
