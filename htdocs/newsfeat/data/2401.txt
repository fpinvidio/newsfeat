SOUTH NYACK, N.Y. — It seems like a generous gift to the people of New York State: a three-mile path for bicyclists and pedestrians stretching across the silvery waters of the Hudson River on a new Tappan Zee Bridge.But many of the residents of South Nyack, at the western end of the bridge, don’t want this gift to land on their doorsteps. At a sometimes raucous meeting on Thursday night at Nyack College overlooking the bridge and attended by a representative of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, residents said the path would invite scores of cars with bike racks scrambling for parking to their tidy streets lined with Victorian houses, would draw food trucks and would unsettle a quiet family neighborhood.“I don’t want a street fair in my neighborhood every weekend,” Susan Pilla, a 49-year-old insurance agent and the mother of two teenagers, said to loud applause from the more than 150 residents packed into a college auditorium.Residents also raised eyebrows at a plan by the state and its Thruway Authority to create two dozen public parking spaces by tearing down the 19th-century village hall or “repurposing” the hall as public bathrooms. They called on the Thruway Authority, the village mayor and other members of a task force to go back to the drawing board to get a more precise idea of how many people were likely to use the bike path during the week and on weekends.
