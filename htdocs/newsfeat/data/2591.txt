From Panoply8. ‘Bad With Money With Gaby Dunn’‘Jagged Little Bills’Lisa Tobin, The Times’s executive producer for audio, suggested this one because she thought it sounded unlike any show she’d heard before. We brought Ron Lieber, the “Your Money” columnist, to the discussion to get his take. Many of us loved the host’s charm and humor, but found the show frustrating from a journalistic and service perspective. Great if you want to be entertained. Not if you want to know how to be better with money.
