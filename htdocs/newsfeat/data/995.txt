PhotoUpdated, 12:07 a.m. ET |News that the United States sent two B-52 bombers on a patrol through China’s newly declared air defense zone prompted widespread criticism Wednesday on Chinese websites, both of the United States for an action many Chinese commentators saw as provocative and of China for its lack of an immediate response.China said that it had monitored the flight and identified the U.S. aircraft, according to a statement posted on the website of China’s Ministry of National Defense shortly after noon Wednesday. “China has the ability to implement effective management and control of the airspace,” the statement added.Even before the Chinese government offered an official reaction to the flight, which was a clear test of China’s stated intention to police the demarcated region in the East China Sea, Chinese blogs lit up with questions about American intentions and Chinese resolve.“If the air defense zone is just a temporary, spoken thing, without means to handle other countries provocatively entering without permission, then we’d be better off not setting it up, because it’s completely unnecessary,” Liu Zhuming, a commentator based in the southwestern city of Chongqing, wrote on his Sina Weibo microblog.The online reaction highlights a quandary for China in the continuing territorial dispute with Japan over islands claimed by both countries in the East China Sea. While steps that could strengthen China’s claim to the islands known as Diaoyu in China and the Senkaku in Japan are welcomed by much of the Chinese public, they also heighten expectations for government resolve.“If the Chinese military doesn’t do anything about aircraft that don’t obey the commands to identify themselves in the zone, it will face international ridicule,” wrote Ni Fangliu, a historian and investigative journalist with more than two million followers on his Tencent microblog account.China established the zone, which calls for aircraft to identify themselves or face possible interception by Chinese military forces, on Saturday, and in the following days some military analysts said they expected a robust enforcement. Meng Xiangqin, a professor at the Strategic Studies Institute of National Defense University in Beijing, said in an interview on state-run China Central Television that if a foreign aircraft entered China’s defensive zone, then antiaircraft missile forces should be in a state of high alert.PLA Daily, the official newspaper of China’s People’s Liberation Army, said in a commentary published before the B-52 flight that the zone required strong warning and defensive capabilities, otherwise its creation is just “armchair strategy.”“Now, we already have those capabilities, so setting up the air defense zone is only logical,” the paper said.The establishment of the zone, which overlaps in places with the defensive air perimeters established by Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, has prompted criticism from Washington and Tokyo that it escalates the continuing territorial dispute. China responded that such designations were normal and had been established by more than 20 nations, including the United States and Japan.Shi Da contributed reporting.
