PhotoOne of my New Year’s resolutions is to use up all of the bags and half-filled bags of dried beans in my pantry before they get too old. Dried beans won’t spoil with age, but once they are more than a year old, they take longer to cook. And sometimes old beans never seem to soften up no matter how long you cook them.Beans are an economical, delicious and comforting way to feed your family well. They are an excellent source of protein, low in fat and exceptionally high in fiber. They are also a good source of calcium, iron, folic acid and potassium. Perhaps it is because beans are so economical that the custom of eating them on New Year’s Day for prosperity exists in so many cultures. Here we eat black-eyed peas (Italians and southern French eat chickpeas; Japanese eat red beans). Try this warm black-eyed peas salad on the first of the year. A Southerner would scoff at this dish, which contains no ham hocks or salt pork. The vibrant salad, which I like to serve warm, proves that those ingredients are not essential for great black-eyed peas.New Year’s Black-Eyed Peas SaladFor the beans:1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil1 medium onion, chopped3 or 4 garlic cloves, minced1 pound black-eyed peas, washed and picked over6 cups water1 bay leafSalt to tasteFor the dressing and salad:1/4 cup red wine vinegar or sherry vinegarAdvertisement Continue reading the main story1 garlic clove, mincedSalt and freshly ground pepper to taste1 to 2 teaspoons lightly toasted cumin, ground (to taste)
