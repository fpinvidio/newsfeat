SEOUL, South Korea — Punishing a foreign tourist with 15 years of prison and hard labor for trying to steal a poster inscribed with a political slogan might seem preposterous in most of the world. This week, North Korea’s Supreme Court did just that to Otto F. Warmbier, a 21-year-old American student.But in North Korea, where the leader is treated as a deity, political slogans are sacrosanct — a point that does not loom large in many outside appraisals of Mr. Warmbier’s plight.At the beginning of each year, North Korea issues a new set of slogans as unbreakable guides. The gate of every factory and the wall of every classroom bear such slogans. The freshly painted and ubiquitous red-on-white banners are virtually the only thing that leaps out in otherwise drab North Korean towns.And the most important among them — the ones that must be treated like sacred objects — are those that bear the names of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, his father Kim Jong-il, and his grandfather, the North’s founding president, Kim Il-sung, North Korean defectors and South Korean officials say.
