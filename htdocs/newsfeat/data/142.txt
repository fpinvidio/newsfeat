Everyone loves beef short ribs. Because the meat is well-marbled, a couple of hoursâ€™ slow cooking keeps it incredibly succulent. This homely combination of beef with carrot, cooked rather plainly, is classic in traditional French cooking, and produces truly delicious results. Like all other braises, this one improves if made a day (or two) in advance of serving, though you can certainly make it all in one go if you wish. Cooking it ahead accomplishes a number of things, not least of which is that it needs only reheating to serve. Another is that refrigerating the braise in its juices always seems to intensify the flavors. Yet one more reason: It is easier to remove the fat on the surface of the liquid when it is cold, rather than trying to skim it from the surface hot.Featured in: The Succulent Short Rib Upends The Roast.
