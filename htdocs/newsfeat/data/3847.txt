PARIS — Société Générale, one of France’s largest banks, reported on Wednesday a rise in first-quarter profit, as a one-time revaluation of its own debt and a shift in the way it prepares for potential bad loans helped it offset a weak market for investment banking.Société Générale said net income rose almost 7 percent to 924 million euros, or about $1.1 billion, in the three months through March from the same period a year earlier.Without one-time items, which included the debt revaluation, profit would have slipped less than 1 percent to €829 million. As it was, the bottom line was better than the market had been expecting. Analysts surveyed by Reuters and Bloomberg had expected earnings to decline as much as €100 million.
