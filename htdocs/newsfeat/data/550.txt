A fruit-filled take on an Amish recipe, this homey baked oatmeal is crunchy from chopped almonds but still soft and comforting from the buttery egg custard that suffuses the oats. You can use any fruit here instead of — or in combination with — the berries. Cubed apples or pears, bananas, pineapple or even mango will add a sweet juiciness to the mix. And for something even richer, serve this doused in heavy cream.
