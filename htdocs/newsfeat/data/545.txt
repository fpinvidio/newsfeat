This recipe, which was adapted from one Valerie Gurdal cooked in the 2013 running of the Westport Paella Contest in Westport, Massachusetts, and brought to The Times by John Willoughby, is classical in its use of rabbit, chorizo, Spanish ham and Calasparra rice. But its depths of flavors are increased exponentially by grilling the meats before adding them to the paella pan. Cooked over an open fire, the dish may be scary to contemplate, but it is not at all difficult to pull off.Featured in: Paella, By Land And Sea.
