Lukeâ€™s Lobster is set to open its third location, on the Upper West Side, by the end of the month. The new place, at 426 Amsterdam Avenue (West 80th Street), will have the same lobster shack feel as the ones at 93 East Seventh Street in the East Village and 242 East 81st Street on the Upper East Side. What will be new? A spicy crab and sweet potato bisque and a hearty fish chowder.
