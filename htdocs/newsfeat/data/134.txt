In Paris’s small neighborhood cafés and bistros, kitchens are extremely small, consisting often of no more than a small wooden cutting board and a wall mounted heavy-duty toaster oven. At lunchtime a hot open-faced tartine — bubbling with fragrant cheese — is a popular menu choice. Similar to a piece of pizza, a tartine is constructed from a thick slice of rustic bread, lightly toasted. A savory topping and some good French cheese precede a few minutes of browning under the broiler. This tartine has a light smear of Dijon mustard, wilted spinach, bacon lardons and the bold-flavored cheese called Raclette, which melts in a spectacular way. If you can’t get Raclette, substitute Gruyère or Emmenthaler. Accompanied by a green salad, it makes a quick light meal, or you may cut the tartine into small wedges to serve with drinks.Featured in: Grilled Cheese? Try A Tartine Recipe Instead.
