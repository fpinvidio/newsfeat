The embattled chairwoman of the New York City Housing Authority faced withering questioning at the City Council on Tuesday about lapses in lead-paint inspections, and she struggled to explain communication failures that left the public uninformed about the risks they posed.Even as she defended the city’s response, the chairwoman, Shola Olatoye, conceded that more could have been done over the past year to tell residents what top officials learned in mid-2016: Lead-paint inspections ceased in 2012 and were not restarted for nearly four years.Her responses prompted exclamations of disbelief from a large audience and expressions of frustration from some council members.Many of the questions focused on the long delay between when officials learned of the problems with inspections — between April 2016 and June 2016, according to Ms. Olatoye — and when City Hall and the agency acknowledged the lapses publicly for the first time, in July 2017.
