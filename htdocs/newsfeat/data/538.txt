This is a more subdued version of fried rice than the spicier Thai fried rice. Itâ€™s a great dish to make if you have cooked rice on hand and a great vehicle for whatever vegetables may be in your refrigerator. Feel free to add other cooked vegetables, meat or seafood.Featured in: Chinese Fried Rice With Shrimp And Peas.
