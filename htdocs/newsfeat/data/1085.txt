Green beans braised with tomatoes, shallot and garlic, and served over thick slices of crusty, country bread is one of the favorite dishes of John Fraser, the 35-year-old chef-owner of Dovetail in Manhattan, whose mother is Greek. It was a staple of his childhood.Mr. Fraser grew up in Yucaipa, Calif., and in the backyard the family grew runner beans and green beans, and then braised one or the other with tomatoes. “You spread the beans over the bottom of the pan, because you want them to have their own space,” he said. “You can eat it hot or cold.”As delicious as the dish is, he does not put it on his menu. Neither will he cook the beans and tomatoes on request.“They’re ugly,” he said. “When you have a green bean and braise it, it doesn’t look good. Things like this are best for home.” The bread has to be thick and crusty, because otherwise it will collapse under the saucy beans. The dish also has to be eaten quickly, or, as Mr. Fraser said, “the bread will sog.”
