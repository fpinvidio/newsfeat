For a quick fish stock, bring three eight-ounce bottles of clam juice to a simmer. Add six shrimp in their shells and simmer, removing the shrimp after four minutes. Shell the shrimp, return the shells to the clam juice and simmer slowly for five minutes more. Strain. Reserve the shrimp for another purpose, or add them to the stew at the last minute.
