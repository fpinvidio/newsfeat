Fresh pasta isn’t something you can master in one go. There’s a learning curve. Only experience can teach you how the dough should feel and how thin to roll it. (Not that it needs to be rolled by hand with a rolling pin. A hand-crank pasta machine is a fine tool, perfect for a small batch.) But pasta making isn’t rocket science either. Most competent home cooks will succeed, even if they never match the prowess of mythic Italian nonnas. Fresh homemade egg pasta is definitely worth the effort, though, and it is always better than commercially produced versions.Featured in: Noodles With No Need To Dress Up.
