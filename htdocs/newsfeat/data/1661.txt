PhotoIf you’re concerned about which fish are environmentally safe to eat, you can’t do better than consulting the Web sites of the Monterey Bay Aquarium or the Environmental Defense Fund for their handy pocket guides for buying seafood (or choosing it in a restaurant). I printed one and put it in my wallet this week, and cooked fish for dinner every night. My son loves seafood, so he didn’t object.I didn’t break the bank buying fresh fish. I looked in the freezer department, where there is often a better selection (depending on where you shop), and was able to find moderately priced varieties. Among them were albacore steaks, one of the few types of tuna that we can still enjoy with a clear conscience, and a great fish to eat if you’re trying to get more omega-3s into your diet, and farmed Arctic char, another fatty fish full of omega-3s.

If you are concerned about the quantity of soy sauce, know that most of it stays behind in the bowl when you cook the fish.
