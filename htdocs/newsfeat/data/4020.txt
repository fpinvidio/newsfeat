That makes Marni especially welcome at the present, when the reigning stance of luxury fashion is aggression, reared up on its hind legs: a mash-up of street wear — in the Virgil Abloh/Supreme sense — and finery, logo-spattered, grimly protective. You used to be able to play around with clothes — not least at Prada, where Mr. Risso spent years. But even Prada, where Miuccia Prada extolled bad taste as well as good and dabbled in fabrics she hated as well as ones she loved, seems stuck in a rut. Compared with dour neutrals and ironic casual wear, Marni is an antidepressant, the Prozac to the prosaic. Here, you still can believe that fashion might be fun.The first day I went, a friend in tow, the ship was manned by two clerks in matching orange sweaters, wrinkled shirts and green pants with their hems undone. Tweedledee and Tweedledum, as I have come to think of them, were kind, laid-back tour guides to the woozy weirdness of the Marni world. (They had dressed identically, they confessed, not entirely on purpose, but not entirely by accident, either — the kind of admission well suited to Wonderland.)
