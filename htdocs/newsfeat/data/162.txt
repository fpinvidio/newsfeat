These tacos arenâ€™t wrapped in tortillas, but in large leaves of Boston lettuce, also called Bibb or butter lettuce, which makes them a good option for those following a low-carb or gluten-free meal plan. Traditional taco seasonings are left behind in favor of Vietnamese ingredients, Thai chiles, rice wine vinegar, lime juice and Vietnamese fish sauce.Featured in: Food; Party Flavors.
