While video of the play seemed to show the injury happening before Nelson’s hit, Justin Houston, a linebacker for the Chiefs, thought Garoppolo could have avoided the issue by just running out of bounds rather than trying to extend the play.“I think that was his fault,” said Houston, who was nearby at the time of the hit. “I pray he’s not hurt, it’s nothing serious, but as a quarterback you should step out of bounds. It’s only an inch. An inch wouldn’t have made a difference. You got the yardage. You need to be smart.”Garoppolo came to the Niners in a trade with the New England Patriots last season and proceeded to go 5-0 as a starter for a team that had been 1-10. Even though Garoppolo had just seven starts over four seasons, San Francisco locked him up with a huge contract that includes more than $70 million in guaranteed money.It has been an uneven start to this season, with the 49ers going 1-2 thus far, but Garoppolo had his team rolling after an early deficit on Sunday, and had completed 20 of 30 passes for 251 yards and two touchdowns in the game before the injury. In his place, C. J. Beathard had his only pass attempt wiped out by a penalty.Beathard, a third-round pick in 2017, went 1-4 as a starter in his rookie season, and Shanahan announced on Monday that he would be the team’s new starting quarterback in what could quickly turn from a year in which San Francisco was expected to compete for a playoff spot to one where the team is a contender for the No. 1 pick in the draft.
