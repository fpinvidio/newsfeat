Cream of coconut, not to be confused with coconut milk or coconut cream, is a thick syrupy confection made by blending coconut and sugar and is most often used in pi√±a coladas. Mixed with cream, coconut milk and shredded coconut, it gives these pops that classic tropical flair. One note: Coconut milk and cream of coconut naturally separate, so be sure to stir well before measuring.
