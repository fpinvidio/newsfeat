If Spike Jonze were still making rap videos and met up with some young British dairy farmers, this is the video he would most certainly have made. It’s an ad for the organic dairy company Yeo Valley in southwest England, part of a multi-million dollar marketing campaign, and it’s a complete work of rapperly art. (Thank you Grist for surfacing it.)It begins like any hip-hop video, with a setting-the-scene shot, except instead of the streets of New York or Los Angeles, it’s the pleasant rolling hills of Somerset, and instead of the whole crew hanging out around an expensive sports car, we see young and very good looking farmers sitting on a waxed, shiny tractor, complete with a close up of a silvery polished cow medallion on the hood.The story begins with the following words:The sun is up.The milk is chilled.It’s gonna be a good one.Yo. Yo. Yo.I’m rollin’ in my Masseyon a summer’s day,chugging cold milkwhile I’m baling hay.Yeo Valley’s approach is common sense.Harmony and nature takes precedence.In lieu of scantily clad back-up dancers, an owl and a few cows bop in time with the beat. And instead of cars bouncing on their hydraulics, a tractor raises itself up with the arm of its digger. The part usually played by well-dressed men and women who lounge on leather banquettes drinking luxury Champagne is taken here by farmers, who recline on the grass, eating spoonfuls of organic yogurt and drinking milk from the bottle.But my favorite part of the video is when the actress playing the female farmer starts to rap:
