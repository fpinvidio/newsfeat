This recipe, adapted from “Sara Moulton’s Everyday Family Dinners,” came to The Times in 2010 as part of a Pete Wells column on redefining the mise en place. Ms. Moulton uses downtime in the cooking process to an advantage: She instructs you to chop the onion and shuck the corn as the edamame cooks. The recipe comes together in about 40 minutes, making it a good one for a busy weeknight -- succotash without suffering.Featured in: Smoky Cheese Grits With Summer Succotash.
