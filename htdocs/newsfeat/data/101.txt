This classic rum cake recipe, built around a yellow cake mix, is a favorite of mushers and snowmobilers passing through the village of Tanana, Alaska, in the wintertime. It's hard to mess up, comes together quickly, fills out a (prepared) Bundt pan reliably and can be made on a whim with ingredients from the pantry. It travels well; keeps, covered, for several days; and pairs nicely with coffee and cold weather.Featured in: In Alaskaâ€™s Far Flung Villages, Happiness Is A Cake Mix.
