WASHINGTON — A city accustomed to power, fame and traffic-stopping motorcades offered an ecstatic reception on Wednesday for Pope Francis, who waved to vast crowds from a special open-sided Jeep and kissed babies carried to him by security personnel.Before the pope’s arrival at the White House on Wednesday morning, onlookers had been gathering for hours, with some camping out all night in hopes of a glimpse of white, the chosen vestments of popes.One spectator, Anna Wolf, said she did not even believe in God, but by 5:39 a.m., she had been waiting eight hours to see Francis. “I think he’s just, like, bringing the truth back,” she said. “I respect him.”
