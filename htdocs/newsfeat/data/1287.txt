Given the breadth of your musical interests, what draws you to Elgar?Elgar commands a mixture of harmonic mastery and originality, with a very unusual rhetoric and emotional palette. In “The Apostles,” the way the story unfolds is hugely inventive: the use of harmony as well as motivic coherence to characterize interior personalities; his ability to interrupt religious or communitarian sentiment with complex doubt; the use of late Romantic vocabulary in a persuasive way that is about the serious questions of existence, without any exit — unlike Strauss, who exits through irony and sarcasm.So do you see Elgar as a progressive or as a conservative?As a progressive. I take the same view of Elgar that Schoenberg took of Brahms. Brahms was viewed as a conservative, and I think that’s nonsensical. Brahms’s imaginativeness in rhythm, harmony and thematic development makes him a progressive force. Elgar is also musically very inventive. His use of dissonance — passing dissonances, radically unprepared modulations that turn in directions one does not expect — is a very sophisticated, progressive tonality. The interesting thing about him as a composer is that he has a distinct harmonic and melodic vocabulary. It’s unmistakably his.
