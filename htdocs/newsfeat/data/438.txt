You don’t need stoneware crocks or special jars to make kimchi. You do need a large bowl and multiple containers. When you become confident, you can add radishes and turnips, but this is the basic formula, from a book on preserving, “Tart and Sweet” by Kelly Geary and Jessie Knadler. The carrots are not strictly traditional, but I particularly like their crunch. Some people like their kimchi “new,” and some let it get really funky. Refrigerated and covered, it lasts indefinitely. I eat it many ways: finely chopped with steamed rice, fried eggs and Japanese sesame salt; stirred into chicken noodle soup; on steak, mixed with fresh watercress. In Korean food, it’s ketchup, mustard and relish, all in one.Featured in: D.I.Y. Cooking Handbook.
