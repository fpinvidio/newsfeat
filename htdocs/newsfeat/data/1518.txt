A court on Tuesday upheld the conviction of an Amazon rancher for orchestrating the 2005 killing of an American nun and rain forest activist. A court in Para State said the rancher, Regivaldo Galvão, must serve his 30-year sentence. Last year, a jury found Mr. Galvão guilty in the killing of Sister Dorothy Stang, but he was quickly freed on appeal. Prosecutors say Mr. Galvão and another rancher, Vitalmiro Bastos de Moura, had Sister Dorothy killed because she was blocking them from illegally obtaining a parcel of land.
