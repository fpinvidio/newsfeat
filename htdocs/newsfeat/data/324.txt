For a richer meal, lobster may be substituted for the shrimp. To prepare, bring 4 cups water to a boil in a large pot. Drop in 2 lobsters (2 pounds each), cover the pot tightly and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the lobsters and let them cool, keeping the water at a simmer. Pry the meat from the claws and tail, reserving the shells, and roughly chop into 1/2-inch pieces. Return the shells to the pot and proceed from Step 1 above, using the lobster water instead of fish stock or clam broth.
