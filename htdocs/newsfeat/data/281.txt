This is the best-selling summer cocktail at Ralph Lauren's Polo Bar in Manhattan, where it is regarded as "summer in a glass." A critical ingredient is French grapefruit liqueur, or pamplemousse, a relatively new spirit that contributes aroma, a touch of sweetness and a bitter edge, even in a small dose. It marries superbly with rosé wine. Consider adding a splash of it to a glass of rosé Champagne.Featured in: Rosé Makes A Peachy Base For Summer Cocktails.
