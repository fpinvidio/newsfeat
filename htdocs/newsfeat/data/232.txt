I like to use black kale for this. I blanch it in the pasta cooking water, then I add the chopped blanched leaves to the tomato sauce at the end of cooking, just so they will heat through and soften a little more. I sear the shrimp and make the tomato sauce in the same pan. You can toss shrimp in the tomato sauce or just top each serving with them, which is the way to go if there are vegetarians at the table.Featured in: The Pasta Is Gluten Free.
