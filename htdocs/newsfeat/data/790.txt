The British bank Barclays said on Sunday that it had agreed to sell its retail and corporate banking business in Spain to CaixaBank for 800 million euros, or slightly more than $1 billion, the latest development in its plan to streamline itself by selling noncore businesses.The Spanish unit, Barclays Bank SAU, includes 2,400 employees across 262 branches, and the price CaixaBank is paying represents a steep discount to the unit’s net asset value of 1.7 billion euros.While Barclays was profitable in its most recent quarter, the British bank has continued to struggle with a host of large fines and regulatory issues, both at home and in the United States. The bank has also seen a number of high-level departures in its executive ranks this year.The sale of the Spanish unit includes retail banking, wealth and investment management, and corporate banking businesses. It does not include investment banking or credit card operations.Barclays also said on Sunday that it would record a gain of around 119 million pounds, or $197 million, after completing the sale of its retail business in the United Arab Emirates to Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank.“I am pleased to be announcing further progress on Barclays noncore asset reductions through the transactions announced today,” Antony P. Jenkins, Barclays group chief executive, said in a statement on Sunday. “We remain on track to rebalance Barclays as part of our strategy to deliver sustainable returns for our shareholders.”
