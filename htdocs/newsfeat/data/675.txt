Even seasoned cooks can be anxious about cooking fish, but nothing could be simpler than oiling a large piece of foil, setting the fish on it and then pressing a few scallions and some thyme into the cavity. Wrap it all into a tightly sealed parcel, put it on a baking sheet and roast it. In truth, any fish can be cooked like this, and you can play around with the herbs, depending on what is available. This is a very good-natured recipe.Featured in: At My Table; Surf 'n' Sweet.Learn: How to Cook Salmon
