For the goggles, Mr. Gutierrez, who now works on airplane flight for the United States Air Force, not only had to start from scratch in building them. He also had to find a bird comfortable with wearing them.The lenses were polycarbonate, snipped out of human laser protection goggles. Mr. Gutierrez used a 3-D printer to make the frames, and went through a lot of trial and error to get the right weight and thickness.Initially he and Dr. Lentink planned on using three birds, but as they and two other colleagues reported in Bioinspiration & Biomimetics on Dec. 6, two of the birds did not tolerate wearing the goggles well.Obi was apparently more willing to try something new. Mr. Gutierrez gave the bird millet seeds, a standard treat, when it had the goggles on, and Obi soon showed no apparent concern about his new outfit. From all appearances, Mr. Gutierrez said, “He was very comfortable.”The point of the study was to test the predictions of conventional mathematical methods for using the swirls of air left in a bird’s wake to calculate the lift, or the force keeping the bird up in the air as it beat its wings.
