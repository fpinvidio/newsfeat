Welcome to The New York Times’s latest ambitious experiment in covering the world and connecting with readers.I’m Damien Cave, your new Australia bureau chief — a Yank, a bit of a larrikin, a father of two, and a writer and editor who has covered a dozen countries. I want to make sure you know how to find our expanded coverage of Australia and the region, and how to connect with our journalists, and with each other.Our primary goal, of course, is to bring you more of the high-quality coverage that you’ve come to expect from Times reporters and photographers around the world. We’re putting together a talented team here that will dig deep and wide. But as we build momentum and deliver more distinctive coverage — like this article on the Great Barrier Reef, or this feature on New Zealand courting global techies — we want you, our audience, to help shape the journey.Here are a few ways you can find us and participate.
