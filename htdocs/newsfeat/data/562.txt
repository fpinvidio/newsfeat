This is a vegetarian take on a classic of Vietnamese restaurants, ca kho, or fish braised in caramel sauce. Here, tofu, firm and rich, takes on the character of savory Asian panna cotta, absorbing the velvety sauce and somehow heightening its flavor.Vietnamese caramel sauce — nuoc mau — is easier to make than you might think, though it can be a dramatic process. In essence what you’re doing is melting sugar in a pan, then allowing it nearly to burn and finally adding water and soy sauce in order to arrest the process at a dark and golden bittersweet flavor that is at the heart of Vietnamese cooking.Featured in: Not Eating Animals.
