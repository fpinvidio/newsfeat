This refreshing creation by Nick Detrich was the best-selling drink at his New Orleans bar, Cane & Table, in 2014. The recognizably tiki-esque mélange of rum and fruit juices is given a delightfully sharp edge by a full ounce of the bitter herbal liqueur Baska Snaps, while the heavy portioning of Peychaud’s bitters helps to dry out the cloying sweetness of the pineapple juice and the orgeat, an almond-flavored syrup. An unlikely but well-balanced cocktail, it is perfect in the hotter months, but good all year round.Learn: How to Make Cocktails
