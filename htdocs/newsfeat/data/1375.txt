“Stay indoors and await further instructions,” read the sickly green letters on the television screen. As Nick’s anxious mother, pregnant sister and doltish brother-in-law bicker and fuss, his father (Grant Masters) takes charge, insisting that the television’s increasingly sinister and divisive dictates be followed exactly. But when suspiciously unsterile “vaccination kits” drop down the chimney like ominous Christmas gifts, Nick and Annji rebel.Harnessing the rhythms of the sitcom and the tropes of the season — there’s even a pitch-black evocation of the Nativity — Mr. Kevorkian casts a wide social-satire net, massaging the link between generational abuse and blind obedience to authority. Horror derives as much from the narrowness of his characters’ minds as the Cronenbergian mortifications of their flesh, creating an all-too-plausible nightmare of media’s ability to turn brother against brother. And while most movies of this type simply peter out, “Instructions” maintains such an unswerving commitment to its dark purpose that its final, gorgeously tenebrous images will leave you wobbly for days.
