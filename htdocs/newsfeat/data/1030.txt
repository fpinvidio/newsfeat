ReutersWelcome to another edition of The Ledeâ€™s very occasional photo quiz series, in which you, the reader, are asked to help us write a post explaining why a curious photograph that has moved across the wires in recent days is newsworthy.The photograph above was taken last week during an anniversary celebration that some people thought was overly extravagant. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to help us explain what, exactly, all the fuss was about.Since we are in the blogging business, the reader who submits the most useful links to news articles on other Web sites that put the photograph into context will be declared the winner.Several readers very quickly defied our expectation that this might be a tough one by answering correctly and supplying us with a variety of excellent links to articles, blog posts, photographs and even a video report in the comments thread below. Thanks and congratulations all round.
