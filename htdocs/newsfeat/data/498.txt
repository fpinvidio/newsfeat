While the turkey is in the oven, get some rest â€” and make the gravy. Giblet gravy requires the cook to use the neck, gizzard and heart of the bird to make deeply flavored stock, which is then combined with the pan drippings, a bit of flour and wine or brandy. Finally, the cooked neck, gizzard and heart are finely chopped and added to the rich, savory gravy, to make for a more interesting texture.Featured in: Cooking Turkey: Everybody Does It A Different Way.
