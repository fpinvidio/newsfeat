With all the political focus in New York City trained on the 2017 mayoral race, there is another important battle being quietly waged, for perhaps the second-most-powerful job in the city.Yet the only votes that matter in this contest are not from constituents; this race, for City Council speaker, will be determined by other Council members and the cityâ€™s Democratic county leaders, who are normally the deciding factor in efforts to wrangle the necessary votes.The current speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, who is to deliver her State of the City address on Thursday, cannot run for re-election because of the term limits law; several other prominent Council members are also serving their last term.Though the race will not be decided until January, the looming vacancy is already swathed in all the bare-knuckled, back-room intrigue of old-time New York: Promises are offered; deals are made. And a leading candidate suddenly emerges.
