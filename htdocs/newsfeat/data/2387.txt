The playwright Stephen Karam has short dark hair, bright dark eyes and a wide smile that occasionally overpowers the rest of his face like some sudden, bloodless coup. On a recent morning at a cafe near his Chinatown apartment in New York, he was eating a red pepper and spinach omelet, a brave attempt to add more vegetables to his diet. At 35, he still looks boyish, and when he talks about being a grown-up, it takes a few seconds to realize that he is actually talking about himself.But Mr. Karam is a mature writer, very much in command of his gifts. His first two screenplays, an adaptation of his breakout play, “Speech & Debate,” and a version of “The Seagull,” for the director Michael Mayer and the producer Tom Hulce, were filmed this summer. His new play, “The Humans,” which had its premiere in Chicago last winter, begins previews Off Broadway on Wednesday, Sept. 30, under Joe Mantello’s direction. It is Mr. Karam’s third play with the Roundabout Theater Company, which essentially built its Roundabout Underground space to house his first with them, “Speech & Debate.”Mr. Karam specializes in painful comedies that really shouldn’t be as funny as they are. In “Speech & Debate,” which centers on three misfit teenagers, at least two characters have undergone traumatic sexual experiences. But try not to giggle when they cavort in nude body stockings. In “Sons of the Prophet,” an unusual amount of suffering is visited on a Lebanese-American clan. Mr. Karam described it as stemming from “pain in my own life, the pain of loss, of losing people suddenly, physical pain.” It is frequently hilarious.In “The Humans,” an Irish-American family’s Thanksgiving dinner is dotted with chatter of depression, dementia, illness and the specter of Sept. 11. This, too, is a comedy. At least in part. It is also possibly a horror story.
