We’ve started you off with one free point: 58 percent of children who were born in the early 1980s and raised in median-income families enrolled in higher education by the time they were 21. One way or another, your chart should go through that point.Time to draw!Draw your line on the chart below↑Free tip: Your line should go through this point.I’m done Start over
