This eggplant dish is a lot like pasta alla Norma, minus the pasta. Instead, it’s the large, crisp chunks of eggplant that star, enrobed in basil-scented marinara sauce and topped with a melting, creamy mix of burrata and ricotta. In this recipe adapted from the chef Amy Brandwein of Centrolina in Washington, D.C., the cubed eggplant is topped with crunchy, salty eggplant chips, sliced ultrathin and deep-fried until golden. But if that’s one step too many when you’re cooking this at home, feel free to leave the chips out.Featured in: A Kitchen Visionary, Reimagining Dishes And A Woman’s Role.
