Would change the way subsidies are distributed by using age, instead of income, as a way to calculate how much people receive. Tax credits would be available in full to individuals earning less than $75,000 and households earning less than $150,000, but they would be capped for higher earners. The subsidy would be $2,000 for a person under 30, and double that for people over 60. The bill would also expand the health plans that qualify for subsidies. The bill was amended Monday to also allow people to deduct more health care expenses from their income taxes, a provision that might be changed in the Senate to instead increase tax credits to older insurance buyers.
