There are a few tricks to making this delicious custard from Julia Child and Alex Prud’homme, which was featured in The Sunday Times Magazine in 2006. Don’t overcook the caramel, and make sure that the baking water only simmers, never boils. When mixing the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisk constantly to avoid curdling the eggs. Individual ramekins can be used in place of a charlotte mold, but dial back the cooking time.Featured in: Sacré Cordon Bleu!.
