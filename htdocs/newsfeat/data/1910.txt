It borders on Syria, Israel and the Mediterranean Sea.Before Lebanon’s civil war began in 1975, it boasted significant financial prosperity and was a popular tourist destination. The war exacted an enormous economic and human toll, and recovery has since been hampered by additional conflicts, including a recent influx of Syrian refugees.Lebanon’s government is a parliamentary democracy established on the principles of confessionalism, a system that distributes power equally among its 18 recognized religious sects.
