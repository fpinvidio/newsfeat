Variation: Curried Lentil Soup: Use 5 cups water. Increase the salt in Step 1, as you will not be reducing the liquid. Reduce the oil in Step 2 to 1 tablespoon, and saut√© the spices after the lentils have simmered for 30 minutes. Let them sizzle for 30 seconds, and remove from the heat. Add them to the lentils along with the salt, and simmer 15 minutes. Puree the soup coarsely with an immersion blender, taste and adjust seasonings. Serve garnished with a dollop of yogurt and a sprinkling of cilantro.
