This is the Supreme cheetah-print jacket, I just copped this here. I got my Ksubi denim on, my rare Supreme Nikes Air Force 1 highs.And the bag?A Chinatown bootleg Supreme pouch.Why did you get the fake one?Items are only worth what a fool will pay for them. To me this is just as good as the vinyl at Louis Vuitton in Paris. It’s like a play on what’s real and fake, because obviously I’m wearing a lot of real stuff.Nice grills.These are 14 karat. I had 10, but I lost some before I came out here.What brings you here?I couldn’t miss a limited-drop situation.
