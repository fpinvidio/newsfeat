Counties that voted for the Republican or Democratic presidential candidate by 20 percentage points or more2016 20161992 1996 2000 2004 2008 2012The proportion of voters living in counties that were won in a landslide for the Democratic or Republican presidential candidate has steadily increased over the last seven elections and now makes up a whopping 60 percent of the electorate.Nearly all of this 10-point increase from 2012 came from Republicans in rural and small-town America, who swept Donald J. Trump into office.For the first time since 2004, the last time a Republican won the White House, the voters in the less populous but more numerous deep red counties accounted for a greater share of the total vote than those in the far fewer but more populous bluest ones.In 1992, 38 percent of voters lived in one of these landslide counties, defined here as being won by 20 percentage points or more. This shift reflects the growing tendency of like-minded people to live near one another, according to Bill Bishop, a co-author of “The Big Sort,” a 2008 book that identified this phenomenon.Mr. Bishop said Americans have been self-segregating by lifestyle, though not necessarily politics, for several decades, but lifestyle has grown to reflect politics. “We’re sorting by the way we live, think and — it turns out — every four years or every two years, how we vote.”Who Lives in These CountiesRepublican landslide counties are generally whiter than Democratic ones.Each colored stripe represents one landslide county in the nation.
