The lure of this pastrami recipe from La Boîte, a spice emporium in Hell’s Kitchen, is that it is a project that does not require a smoker. The essential ingredients are smoked salt and Prague powder (the curing salt sodium nitrite). Both are sold online. It will take nearly a week to make, but the meat is mostly unattended. You could start it on Monday and have it ready for Sunday dinner. The pastrami — reheated and served with warm sauerkraut, or sliced on rye with mustard and sauerkraut — makes for superb cold-weather feasting. Keep it in mind as you plan for the Super Bowl or other occasions for feeding a crowd.Featured in: Brown Ales May Be Unfashionable, But The Style Is Timeless.
