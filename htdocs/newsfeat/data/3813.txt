WASHINGTON — President Trump’s fresh acknowledgment that his top campaign advisers met at Trump Tower in June 2016 with Kremlin-connected Russians to “get information on an opponent” has renewed questions about whether his son Donald Trump Jr., who arranged the encounter, is facing legal trouble.The president blasted as “fake news” a Washington Post article that said he was fearful that Donald Trump Jr. “inadvertently may have wandered into legal jeopardy.” He also tweeted on Sunday that seeking opposition research was “totally legal” and “done all the time in politics.”And Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s lawyers, said in an interview on ABC’s “This Week” that “the question is what law, statute or rule or regulation’s been violated?”“Nobody’s pointed to one,” he said.Here is a look at some ways Donald Trump Jr. may be in legal jeopardy.
