For Catherine Bazerghi, a Texas native, life in New York City began in 2011, with a roommate on the Lower East Side. “It was such a rude awakening,” she said. “It was less than 500 square feet for a two-bedroom, and I came from a 950-square-foot one-bedroom in Dallas.”Ms. Bazerghi, who previously worked in retail and e-commerce and is now seeking a new position in e-commerce, later roomed with a friend in the Gramercy area and then moved into her sister’s two-bedroom condominium in Hoboken, N.J. She paid $1,000 a month in rent and was able to save toward a studio of her own.
