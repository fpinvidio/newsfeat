This drink, from Jackrabbit at the Duniway restaurant in Portland, Ore., calls for an assertive rosé as its base, and rightly so: The combination of ingredients tilts the drink toward serious cocktail territory. The rosé defines it, and the herbal notes contributed by the other sprits give it character. Serve it on the rocks if you prefer. (The name is a play on City of Roses, as Portland is sometimes known; the wine the restaurant uses is from Division Winemaking Company, in the city.)Featured in: Rosé Makes A Peachy Base For Summer Cocktails.
