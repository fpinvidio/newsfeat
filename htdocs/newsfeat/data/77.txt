Can flour, beer and little else be turned into steaming, golden bread in under an hour? Yes, and this recipe shows you how. When making beer bread with whole-wheat flour, light is what you want. No yeast is needed â€” the beer does the proofing work. Use a local lager, and add rosemary and a generous amount of honey. Finish it with butter, sea salt.Featured in: Visiting The Source | A Chef In The Field: Wheat Berries.
