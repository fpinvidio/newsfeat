Though there are a lot of ingredients in this recipe, it's a straightforward chicken saute-and-sauce combination. Brown the chicken -- dark meat is preferable -- then lightly brown the seeds, then soften the vegetables. The tomatillos, if canned, provide enough liquid; if you're using fresh tomatillos you might need to add a little water or stock, but not much. The chicken simmers in the sauce, and lime juice completes the picture. This is traditionally served with a host of garnishes, which I see as optional but fulfilling.Featured in: Saut√© And Sauce, Green And Greener.
