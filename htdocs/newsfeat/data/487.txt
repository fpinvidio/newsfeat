This recipe is a far departure from the mayonnaise-based tuna concoctions that Americans expect. Tuna (packed in olive oil, please) is mixed with peppers, fresh herbs and nuts and dressed in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice and two types of mustard. It can sit in the fridge for up to three days, making it excellent picnic food or just a departure from the usual sad desk sandwich.Featured in: Food; Assembly Required.
