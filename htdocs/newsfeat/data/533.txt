This recipe, adapted from “The Alaska from Scratch” Cookbook," by Maya Wilson, transforms a brothy lentil soup into a spicy, warming main dish with the addition of fresh Mexican-style chorizo and chopped kale. This simple winter dinner also features carrots, which grow unusually sweet in Alaska's summer light and temperatures, and are a root-cellar staple. Sweet or spicy Italian sausage works well as a substitute for the chorizo.Featured in: Finding Produce In Alaska’s Long Winter Takes Wiles And Luck.
