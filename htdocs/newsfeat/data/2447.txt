RIO DE JANEIRO — The sweeping corruption scandal shaking Brazil’s establishment intensified on Tuesday after the police arrested the mastermind of the military’s secret nuclear program during the 1970s and ’80s.With the arrest of that figure, Othon Luiz Pinheiro da Silva, a retired navy admiral, what started as a bribery inquiry at the national oil company, Petrobras, seems to have taken on a life of its own, with one prominent figure after another becoming ensnared in accusations of a broad web of graft involving state-controlled enterprises and some of the country’s most powerful private companies.Prosecutors said Mr. Pinheiro da Silva, 76, took more than $1.3 million in bribes as chief executive of Eletronuclear, a public company that operates two nuclear power plants. The bribes, which the prosecutors said were paid from 2009 to 2014, were related to contracts with construction companies building a third plant, Angra 3, near Rio de Janeiro.During the military dictatorship, which lasted from 1964 to 1985, Mr. Pinheiro da Silva, a nuclear engineer educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, oversaw a clandestine operation to build reactors for submarines.
