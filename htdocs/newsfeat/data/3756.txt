RAROTONGA, Cook Islands — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton began a 10-day, 6-nation visit to Asia pledging to broaden American diplomatic, economic and security support in the Pacific, but also offering conciliatory remarks toward China at a time when tensions are rising over territorial disputes.“We all have important contributions and stakes in this region’s success — to advance your security, your opportunity and your prosperity,” she told leaders on Friday at the Pacific Island Forum, an annual conference of 16 nations and self-governing states located across a vast stretch of ocean. “I think, after all, the Pacific is big enough for all of us.”Mrs. Clinton’s visit, the first by a secretary of state to the forum and to the remote Cook Islands, nevertheless highlighted an intensifying race between China and the United States for influence in a part of the world that President Obama has tried to make a greater focus of American foreign policy.Mrs. Clinton, accompanied at the forum by the head of the Pacific Command, Adm.
