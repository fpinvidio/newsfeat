Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid said on Thursday that they had called off their long-planned merger after antitrust authorities indicated they were not likely to approve the combination of two of the nation’s biggest drugstore chains.Instead, Rite Aid will sell 2,186 stores, out of a total of 4,600, and three distribution centers to Walgreens for $5.18 billion, ending nearly two years of negotiations between the chains.“While we’re disappointed that we cannot complete the proposed merger with WBA, we believe that this asset sale is an important strategic transformation for Rite Aid,” John T. Standley, Rite Aid’s chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts, using the ticker symbol for Walgreens.Shares of Rite Aid tumbled as much as 30 percent on Thursday — its steepest plunge since December 2007 — and closed down more than 26 percent.
