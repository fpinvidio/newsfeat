The Senate confirmed each of President Trump’s nominees that faced a vote. Fifteen members of the cabinet and eight other top administration posts require Senate confirmation.All but nine of the “no” votes came from Democrats and were essentially symbolic statements of opposition. Nominees need only a simple majority to be confirmed, and Republicans hold 52 seats in the Senate.
