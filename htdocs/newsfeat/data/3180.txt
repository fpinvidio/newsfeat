“I have two words to leave with you tonight, ladies and gentlemen: inclusion rider,” Frances McDormand said Sunday night at the end of a rousing acceptance speech for the best actress Oscar in which she urged all other female nominees to stand up and reminded the audience that every woman standing had stories to tell and projects that needed financing.So what is an inclusion rider? As Stacy Smith, who researches gender equality in film and television at the University of Southern California, has put it, it’s the idea that A-list actors have the ability to stipulate in their contracts that diversity be reflected both onscreen and in “below the line” positions, where women, people of color, and members of L.G.B.T. communities are traditionally underrepresented.
