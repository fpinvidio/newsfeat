This impressive-looking pie is more like a traditional apple tart: Thin slices of apples are tightly arranged, then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. In the oven, the apples soften and create a delicious, jammy base inside a buttery, flaky crust. Grouping the slices by color creates a stunning ombr√© effect, but the rest of the recipe is simple to make up for the assembly time. The recipe calls for a generous number of apples to be sure you fill the crust; use any leftovers for snacking or to make applesauce. Store any leftovers at room temperature, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap.Featured in: 8 Spectacular Pies That Taste As Good As They Look.
