Whether you get them from your backyard garden or the local farmers' market, tomatoes are one of summer’s sweetest staples. In the kitchen, one of the best things a cook can do with a surfeit of ripe summer tomatoes is not to cook them. With such tasty beauties available (and given the tomato-pleasing heat), salads make more sense. Start simply by slicing big tomatoes into rounds and cutting smaller ones into wedges and the cherry and grape varieties in half. Very gently toss them with fresh herbs, balsamic vinegar, olive oil and good salt. Use whatever you’ve got to hand to dress up the pile. Here, we’ve used some crumbled blue cheese for tang, fresh figs for sweetness and a sprinkle of toasted pine nuts for crunch.Featured in: Never Say ‘No’ To A Tomato Vine.Learn: How to Make Salad
