Poached chicken breasts, which are at the center of this salad, are a low-fat, high-protein staple with endless possibilities. In this recipe, inspiration comes from the Southeast Asian country of Indonesia. Mint leaves and cilantro add a fresh bite and mung bean sprouts or sunflower sprouts help to fill out the dish. This spicy, refreshing salad makes a great summer meal.Featured in: Chicken Dishes, With Less Chicken.
