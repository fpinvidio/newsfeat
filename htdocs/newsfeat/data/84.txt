This is a lamb dish done schnitzel-style, devised as a pairing for blaufr√§nkisch wine from Austria. Ask your butcher to pound slices of top round of lamb, from the leg, only lightly, which will result in pieces that are about a half-inch thick, providing enough tolerance so the meat can brown without overcooking. Refrigerating the coated slices before frying them helps, too. A pesto sauce, made with mint leaves and zapped with horseradish, picks up some of the herbal and pepper flavors in the wine. Warm potato salad in a vinaigrette dressing would be a perfect side dish for the schnitzel.Featured in: Lamb With A Pesto That Packs A Wallop.
