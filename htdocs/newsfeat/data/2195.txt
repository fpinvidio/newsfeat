Relatives of churchgoers killed in a shooting in Charleston, S.C., appeared in court on Friday to confront Dylann Storm Roof, the suspect, with emotional tributes to their loved ones.“You have killed some of the most beautiful people that I know,” said Felicia Sanders, whose son, Tywanza Sanders, was one of the nine victims on Wednesday. “Every fiber in my body hurts, and I’ll never be the same. Tywanza Sanders was my son, but Tywanza was my hero.”The daughter of Ethel Lance told the suspect that she forgave him. Anthony Thompson, the husband of Myra Thompson, asked that he repent.Mr. Roof watched silently on a video link.
