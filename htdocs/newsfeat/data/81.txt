Here is a deeply flavored salad that can be prepared entirely outdoors, keeping the heat out of the kitchen. Grill a whole fat purple globe eggplant until the skin blisters. Then scrape the soft insides into a bowl and season them with red wine vinegar, garlic, good olive oil and fresh herbs. A few capers on top add a pleasing brininess. Serve it with pita bread, a good ros√© and a hunk of feta, and want for nothing more.Featured in: Counting The Ways To Cook An Eggplant.Learn: How to Make SaladLearn: How to Grill
