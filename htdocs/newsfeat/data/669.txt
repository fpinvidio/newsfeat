Briny clams come together with smoky bacon and sautéed leeks in this showstopper. Quick to prepare, this weeknight recipe is decidedly sophisticated. First, sauté the bacon, add the garlic and leeks and add some good white wine and tomatoes. Toss with al dente linguine and top with clams and lemon juice. Finish with it with parsley and pine nuts, and pour yourself a glass of that wine. With this simple, elegant meal, you’ve earned it.Featured in: The Dish: Endangered List; Thank You For Smoking.
