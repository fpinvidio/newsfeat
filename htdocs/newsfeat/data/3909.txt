The region has eight indigenous peoples who have had some contact with the outside world, and at least 11 others without any known contact, Funai said in a statement. The agency said its team had traveled more than 110 miles in “boats, trucks, motorcycles” and about 75 miles “on foot through dense forest” to reach the location.[A lone survivor of a tribe in the Amazon was recently filmed on video.]The team, accompanied by the police, caught two groups of outsiders hunting illegally, and found a landowner and farmers encroaching illegally on land reserved for indigenous groups, Funai added.Such encroachment and destruction of the rain forest, often accompanied by violence against the indigenous peoples, threaten their survival.Last month, Funai released video of a man in another part of Brazil who is thought to be the last surviving member of his tribe.
