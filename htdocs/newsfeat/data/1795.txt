Stocks on Wall Street closed higher on Friday as investors weighed whether a stronger-than-expected rise in United States jobs figures meant the Federal Reserve would rein in its monetary stimulus sooner rather than later.By the end of trading all three major indexes — the Standard & Poor’s 500-share index, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite — were 1 percent higher.United States employers added 195,000 jobs in June and hiring was more robust in the two previous months than earlier estimated, a Labor Department report said. The unemployment rate, however, remained at a relatively high 7.6 percent.The report suggests growth is increasing in the world’s largest economy and that the Federal Reserve would likely begin winding down its monetary stimulus in the autumn.
