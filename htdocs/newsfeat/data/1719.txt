The researchers think that some time during the Early Cretaceous Period, a massive herbivorous dinosaur similar to an Iguanodon fell into a shallow swamp or bog. There, its head quickly became buried beneath the sediment. As it stewed in the stagnant, acidic pool, minerals began to replace the soft tissue in the cranium, preserving it for millions of years.“The acid solution would have pickled the parts of the brain that were immersed,” Dr. Norman said.He added that the brain, which is incomplete, does not tell us much about dinosaurs. We already knew that they had brains, and we already thought their brains would probably look similar to those of crocodiles and birds. Instead, he thinks the finding will help get paleontologists to investigate their fossils more carefully because they could never know what might be hiding within them.“It’s uniquely remarkable,” he said, “but it’s not going to change the way we think.”
