This recipe is based on a dish from the chef Seamus Mullen of Tertulia in New York. It’s inspired by a Catalan honey-and-cheese dessert called mel i mató, with an unexpected sprinkle of pistachios and fresh peaches.After falling ill, Mr. Mullen changed his diet to focus more on ingredients with anti-inflammatory effects. Many such foods, like stone fruits, often play a central role in the Spanish cuisine he specializes in.Featured in: A Chef Finds Healing In Food.
