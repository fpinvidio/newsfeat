Dear Diary:It was late, and I was lost in the East Village. I was on my way to an opening at a small art gallery. I didnâ€™t have my iPhone; even if I had, I never would have found the place.I asked a young man for help. He was probably in his mid-20s. He found the appropriate map on his phone and showed me the way.When he saw that I was having difficulty following his directions, he offered to escort me. I thanked him profusely, and when we arrived at the gallery I told him to tell his mother, from me, that she had raised a lovely son.He asked if I would tell her. I said I would be delighted to.He dialed her number, and told her that he was with someone who wanted to talk to her. He put me on the phone, and she and I had a lovely conversation.
