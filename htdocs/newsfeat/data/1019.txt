As my colleague David Kirkpatrick reports from Tunisia, protesters there have been using the Web to organize demonstrations and spread news of violent clashes with the security forces in recent weeks.Last week, one activist and blogger, Slim Amamou, even managed to alert the world to the fact that he had been arrested by apparently turning on his phone and using Google Latitude to reveal his location: inside an interior ministry building in the capital, Tunis.*Nawaat.orgSome of the most evocative, and disturbing, images of the protests and clashes have appeared in video clips posted on YouTube.On Tuesday, for instance, contributors to the group blog Nawaat — who also uses Twitter and Facebook to report on the protests — uploaded video to their YouTube channel showing new demonstrations in the cities of Bizerte, Sfax and Douz.This footage, apparently shot on a phone, shows protesters clashing with the security forces in the city of Bizerte, on Tunisia’s north coast:These two clips show smoke from fires on the streets of Sfax, on the Mediterranean coast, and a group of protesters there singing the country’s national anthem:(Note that this clip of the crowd singing the anthem also shows someone recording it on a mobile phone camera.)More than 20 protesters have been killed in clashes with the security forces so far. On Tuesday, after Agence France-Presse reported that two people were killed in Douz, the Nawaat bloggers uploaded an extremely graphic clip showing the body of a man they identify as a university professor, “shot by the Tunisian government police’s snipers today during the protest in the southern city of Douz.”One day earlier, the Nawaat bloggers posted video of a clash in the city of Kasserine on Monday. It shows protesters retreating from what sounds like gunfire. Information posted with the clip suggested that four people were killed in six minutes in this area.On Tuesday, after visiting Sidi Bouzid, where the demonstrations started last month, the blogger Lina Ben Mhenni posted images and a first-hand account of the situation in Kasserine on her blog A Tunisian Girl.Among the blogger’s photographs was one of local lawyers engaged in a sit-in on the steps of the city’s court house, “against the use of live ammunition during demonstrations.”On Monday, Nawaat also uploaded video of students in Tunis spelling out the Arabic word for “Freedom.”An Al Jazeera report on the protests on Sunday included several YouTube clips of previous demonstrations and clashes:Al Jazeera’s report also showed part of a viral video by a Tunisian rapper, Hamada Ben-Amor, known as The General. After Mr. Ben-Amor, who is 22, was arrested at his home in Sfax last week, his brother told Al Jazeera: “Some 30 plainclothes policemen came to our house to arrest Hamada and took him away without ever telling us where to. When we asked why they were arresting him, they said, ‘he knows why.'”Last week Mr. Ben-Amor posted a rap video online, “President, Your People are Dying,” that begins with a clip of the country’s authoritarian president, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.The president was also undermined by a viral YouTube clip last month, when Tunisian bloggers recorded and shared part of his televised, live address to the nation on the crisis, which was interrupted by a ringing telephone.*An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that the Tunisian blogger Slim Amamou had used FourSquare instead of Google Latitude to signal his location.
