Not all that long ago, the White Russian was considered pass√© and often likened to an alcoholic milkshake. The cocktail, whose culinary precursor is the Alexander, is believed to date to the 1950s or early 1960s. And it gained popularity in the days of disco, which may have added to its dated reputation.But then, the Coen Brothers released "The Big Lebowski," a movie about an aging slacker who calls himself the Dude, played with slouchy brio by Jeff Bridges. The Dude's chief pursuits involve bowling, avoiding work and drinking White Russians, or as the character calls them, "Caucasians."Featured in: White Russians Arise, This Time At A Bowling Alley.
