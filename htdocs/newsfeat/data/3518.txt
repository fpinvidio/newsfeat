BERLIN — The results of German state elections, in which an insurgent far-right party garnered up to 25 percent of the vote, have signaled a rare turn toward political vulnerability for Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as potential instability for her country and perhaps paralysis for Europe as a whole.Whether Europeans like it or not, they have come to count on Ms. Merkel’s leadership through successive crises in the past decade. Ms. Merkel’s Germany has seemed impervious to the protest votes and economic woes engulfing much of the Continent.But the elections in two western states and an eastern one on Sunday amounted to a stark warning that Germans are not happy with the prospect of integrating a million migrants and refugees from the wars in Iraq and Syria.The outcome is likely to further complicate efforts to solve a migration crisis in which coordination among Europeans is already so haphazard that Ms. Merkel has looked to Turkey to solve the problem for them.
