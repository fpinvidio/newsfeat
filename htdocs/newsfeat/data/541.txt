Adding a few tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder to your morning oatmeal turns a quotidian breakfast into something unexpectedly complex and bittersweet, while browning the butter adds a nutty richness. You can adapt this recipe to work in your slow cooker or pressure cooker, if thatâ€™s your preference. Just brown the butter and oats first, then whisk the cocoa into the boiling water until no lumps remain, and proceed as you usually do. For something a little mellower, substitute whole milk, nut milk or coconut milk for up to half of the water.Featured in: Yes, Adults Can Have Chocolate For Breakfast. Really..
