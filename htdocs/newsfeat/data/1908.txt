The worst thing about the rallies is that Trump keeps coming back to immigration, even though recent events have made it crystal clear that this is poisoning the nation. (“We’re getting prepared for the caravan folks, you don’t have to worry about that.”)He’s now adding a plug for his new plan to toss out the part of the Constitution that says if you’re born here, you’re a citizen — an idea that has even Paul Ryan reeling. (“People didn’t want to bring it up. I said we have to bring it up.”)We know now that both the alleged pipe bomb-maker and the synagogue shooting suspect were obsessed with immigrants. Immigrant-bashing is what Trump thinks is the key to winning the midterms. It’s also the place where Trump becomes an abettor in the right-wing, white nationalist turmoil that’s torturing the country.It’s insane to expect him to lift up the nation. But is it too much to ask that he just avoid the violence-inducing themes in his repertoire?For instance, he loves to remind his fans that he won the election, and that’s a safe topic. Maybe he could devote half an hour of every rally to his theory that it’s harder to win electoral votes than the popular vote. Plus crowd estimates — he could spend some time claiming that 47 percent of the entire population of Fort Wayne, Ind., was standing outside the door, in terrible weather, just to watch him on closed-circuit television.We’re better off if he talks about the mysterious promise of a 10 percent tax cut known to no one in Washington but Donald Trump. And the Space Force! (“So important. That’s where it’s at.”)What else could he say that isn’t dangerous? Well — he could talk about the things the Republican majority did over the last two years. O.K., that definitely wouldn’t fill up an hour.
