After examining more than 3,600 fossilized leaves from Patagonia for insect damage, researchers have concluded that it took about 4 million years for insects in South America to recover after the mass extinction event that ended the Cretaceous period.They reported their findings Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.“We found that plant-feeding insects in Patagonia recovered much faster after the asteroid that hit Mexico 66 million years ago compared to insects in the western United States,” said Michael Donovan, a graduate student in geosciences at Pennsylvania State University and lead author of the study which included researchers from Argentina. The findings suggest that ecosystems in different parts of the world repaired themselves at different rates following the asteroid impact.Like their modern-day counterparts, ancient beetles, moths, flies, wasps, grasshoppers and other insects all feasted upon plants in unique ways, leaving behind distinct patterns of damage. Some bit holes through leaves while others only munched on the top or bottom layers. Some chewed along the veins of the leaf while others chomped through it. Others used their strawlike mouthparts to pierce the leaves and suck up juices. Larvae burrowed through the leaves and created tunnel marks while eggs leave lumps in the leaves.
