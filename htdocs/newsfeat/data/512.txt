Stews and braises are for year-round cooking, but warmer weather calls for a lighter approach. This stew is quite brothy, and full of greens, wilted in olive oil with green garlic, carrots and fava beans or peas. A healthy sprinkling of roughly chopped mint adds brightness. Itâ€™s important to use dried chickpeas, because they add flavor to the broth as they slowly cook with the lamb. And an overnight soak is essential: The soaked dried chickpeas will swell to three times their original size, which gives them the proper creamy texture when cooked.Featured in: Lamb Stew, Now Lighter And Brighter.
