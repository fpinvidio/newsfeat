Nelson D. Schwartz has worked at The New York Times for a decade and has covered economics since 2012. Before that, he wrote about Wall Street and banking for The Times, and also served as European economic correspondent in Paris from 2008 to 2010. He joined the paper in 2007 as a feature writer for the Sunday Business section.Mr. Schwartz is interested in all aspects of the American economy, with an eye toward combining human stories with data that tells the larger tale. He is especially interested in inequality, the future of manufacturing, and how workers and companies are adapting to the technological and economic changes transforming the country and the world.Recent stories include his coverage throughout 2016 of the fate of Carrier’s factory in Indianapolis and its 1,400 workers, which President Trump made a touchstone of his campaign after the company announced plans to move production to Mexico. Reporting from Indiana both well before and after the election, Mr. Schwartz’s initial March 2016 story was early in calling attention to the Midwestern workers who would ultimately help put Mr. Trump in the White House.Another project is his continuing Velvet Rope economy series, which looks at how inequality is transforming business. He also covers monthly and quarterly data on employment and growth. In 2014, Mr. Schwartz was the recipient of the Nathaniel Nash Award, given annually by The Times to the reporter who “best excels in business and economic news.”Mr. Schwartz is a graduate of the University of Chicago, and worked for 10 years at Fortune Magazine before joining the Times. A native of Scarsdale, N.Y, he lives with his family on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
