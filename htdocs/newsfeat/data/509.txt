This chili-like stew relies on spicy, fresh green chorizo for its bright, zesty flavor. It only takes half an hour to make your own green chorizo, but you can substitute any kind of fresh (uncured) store-bought sausage, as long as itâ€™s got a kick. Then add some chopped garlic, along with minced parsley and roasted poblano pepper for the green factor. Serve it over rice, or with corn or flour tortillas on the side.Here are several other dishes you can make with chorizo.Featured in: The Lively Look Of Green Chorizo.
