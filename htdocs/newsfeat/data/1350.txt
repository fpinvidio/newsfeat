WASHINGTON — The White House said on Wednesday that Russia had violated professional military norms over the Baltic Sea when one of its planes flew “dangerously close” to an American ship and a Polish aircraft.“Any peacetime military activity must be consistent with international laws and norms,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said. He said there had been “repeated incidents” over the last year in which the Russian military planes have come close to other air and sea traffic in “provocative” actions.“We continue to be concerned about this behavior,” Mr. Earnest said. The episodes, he added, are “a source of some irritation.”He declined to say whether or how the administration planned to raise the issue with Russia.
