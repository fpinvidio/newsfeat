PhotoRecipes for Health Martha Rose Shulman on healthful cooking.I’ve been giving some thought to dairy-free, not-too-sweet smoothies. I usually use yogurt or buttermilk in my smoothies, but this week I wanted to make some drinks using almond milk and coconut milk. I looked around for some brands that tasted good to me (and I did need to look around), and found some great almond milk made with just about only almonds and water (it has less than 2 percent added ingredients but no sweeteners). For the others, I wanted to use coconut milk, not coconut water, which I think tastes pretty bad no matter how good for you it’s supposed to be. I used light coconut milk in conjunction with almond milk in a few of this week’s smoothies.Though I recently devoted a week of Recipes for Health to green smoothies, these smoothies are pure fruit; they are not low-carb. Most of them make filling breakfasts or snacks and will appeal to you if you are vegan and enjoy fruit. I have bulked them up with soaked nuts, chia seeds and oatmeal and added very little in the way of sweeteners. I liked the green smoothies, but I still prefer to eat my vegetables in solid form.You don’t need a special high-powered blender for this week’s drinks. I’m still using the 5-cup, 2-speed Waring blender my mother gave me years ago and it works just fine.Berry Coconut Almond Smoothie : Cinnamon is the secret ingredient in this rich berry smoothie.Banana Oatmeal Almond Smoothie : Oatmeal bulks up this smoothie, making it more filling.Frozen Strawberry-Coconut Smoothie With Pomegranate Molasses : Fruity pomegranate molasses is the perfect sweetener for this thick strawberry smoothie.Peach Almond Smoothie : Peaches and almonds are closely related and make a great match in this not-too-sweet smoothie.Cantaloupe-Lime Agua Fresca With Chia Seeds : A light, refreshing blender drink that is sweet and a little bit tart.
