If turducken tempts you, consider the Roebling Tea Room in Brooklyn for Thanksgiving, where the boneless chicken stuffed into a duck stuffed into turkey is the centerpiece for a three-course dinner by the chef, Joey Cole, who was at Per Se. As for turducken at home, you can buy one ready to cook from a specialty butcher like Edwards Virginia Smokehouse in Surry, Va.: Thanksgiving dinner, $75 for three courses, Roebling Tea Room, 143 Roebling Street (Metropolitan Avenue), Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-963-0760, events@roeblingtearoom.com; Edwards Virginia Smokehouse, $59.95 for four-pound turducken, edwardsvaham.com/product/turducken-roll.Image Credit Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesTo Pour: Mulberry Gin Is a Festive Holiday SpiritLet’s start by acknowledging that Boodles’s new mulberry gin, positioned as the first of its kind in the American market, is not gin-like at all. It is lower in alcohol (60 proof) and is deeply mellow and fruity, more like a brightly festive liqueur than a spirit. Consider topping it off with sparkling wine as your Thanksgiving aperitif (add a dried cranberry to the glass), or give it some muscle mixed half-and-half with straight gin. Then again, you might serve it chilled with dessert for sipping after dinner: Boodles Mulberry Gin, $29, staging.reservebar.com/products/boodles-mulberry.Image Credit Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesTo Schlep: Carry That Load With ConfidenceShopping or bringing something for Thanksgiving dinner?
