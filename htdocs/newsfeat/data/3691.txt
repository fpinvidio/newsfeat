No members of Eagles of Death Metal were killed, but colleagues and family members took to social media to mourn the death of Nick Alexander, a British citizen who was at the concert and was described as a merchandise seller for the band. Mr. Alexander had worked with a number of rock bands over the years, including Alice in Chains, which described him in a post on the band’s Facebook page as “a great guy and a true professional.” Delphine De Peretti, a 35-year-old project manager, learned of the attacks last night after leaving the theater in London, where she lives. She immediately called her sister, Aurélie, 33, who was in Paris and had attended the concert at the Bataclan. There was no answer.On Saturday morning, Ms. De Peretti said she took the Eurostar train from London to Paris and joined her mother, who had come up from her home in the south of France.“We spent all morning looking for her,” she said.Then her mother got a call from the Paris medical examiner’s office asking her to come by.“They told us my sister was dead but they did not let us see her,” she said, adding, “I am like a robot. I don’t know what to do next. I have not watched the news or slept since last night.”Speaking outside a counseling center, still holding a suitcase, Ms. De Peretti described her sister as fond of music and culture; she had loved to draw since she was a child.“My only concern right now is to be able to bring back her body and bring her with us to the south of France,” she said.
