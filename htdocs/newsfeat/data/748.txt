UBS, the largest Swiss bank, gave a bit of positive news Thursday morning amid the financial maelstrom: It said it expects to eke out a “small profit” for the third quarter. That would be the bank’s first quarterly profit since the credit crunch began last summer, and the announcement comes as other European banks, such as Fortis, are struggling to regain their footing as the credit crunch continues.The update, which came just before UBS held its second “extraordinary general meeting” of the year in Switzerland, came as a pleasant surprise to analysts, many of whom expected the bank to spend another quarter in the red.How did UBS manage a profit, even a small one, in these tough times? Analysts and investors may need to wait until the bank gives a full earnings report on Nov. 4 to know the answer.But UBS did say Thursday that it managed to get rid of a large chunk of its United States mortgage-related exposures, “mainly through disposals.” These kinds of securities had caused many of its problems.If the company expects a profit in the third quarter, that may suggest it got a decent price for those mortgage-related assets. It is not clear yet who bought them, but it could mean that there is an active market for these distressed assets — and whoever is buying them is not demanding fire-sale prices.UBS bet big on the United States housing market and has sustained the worst losses so far of any European bank during the recent mortgage meltdown.It took its write-downs early and hard — $44.2 billion in total — and raised $23 billion in capital to plug the holes in its balance sheet. Since October, it has cut 7,000 jobs and is reportedly set to cut 10 percent of its investment banking staff worldwide.At the end of June, UBS still had $16.6 billion in total net residential mortgage exposure, $3.1 billion of which was subprime, according to analysts at Oppenheimer & Company. It also had $8.2 billion in commercial mortgage and real-estate exposure.Those assets were priced at the end of June, when the market was assigning them a higher value. If the bank expects to book a profit for the third quarter, that would imply that either its continuing operations performed well enough to offset any mortgage-related write-downs — which is doubtful given the state of the capital markets — or that it didn’t have to write down the value of its assets by such a large amount.Analysts at Vontobel were expecting UBS to have 4.5 billion Swiss francs ($3.9 billion) in write-downs this quarter, but they now say they believe its write-downs were somewhat less — $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion.That could be a good sign for banks still needing to unload troubled assets on the market: It may suggest that they can sell them at prices that aren’t too painfully low, even without a government bailout fund.Go to Press Release from UBS »
