This recipe came to The Times from Fanny Singer, the daughter of Alice Waters, the chef and food activist. It’s inspired by Ms. Singer’s favorite street food. Ceviche is almost always so astringent that the fish loses identity, but the freshness of the ingredients and softness of the lime marinade here are neither confrontational nor eye-squinching. It’s simple stuff: avocado, grapefruit, prickly chile, cilantro, lime and an absolutely fresh sea creature. Making the dish takes a bit of work, but it’s the perfect recipe for when you don’t want to turn on the stove.Featured in: Kitchen Voyeur; Organically Grown.
