This recipe is adapted from “The Pleasures of Cooking for One” by Judith Jones, Julia Child’s longtime editor at Knopf, who gave it to The Sunday Times Magazine in 2009. It is easily prepared and a savory accompaniment to a steak or roast, crisp and buttery, with just a hint of garlic.Featured in: Raising Steaks.Learn: How to Cook Potatoes
