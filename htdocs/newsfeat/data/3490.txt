MOSCOW, Aug. 9 — In a new case of cold-war-style espionage, Russia on Wednesday announced the conviction of a retired military officer who had pleaded guilty to charges that he passed state secrets to Britain for nearly a decade.The officer, identified as Col.

Scientists who cooperated with foreign colleagues have been accused of espionage, including one sentenced Tuesday. There have also been disclosures like the one in January that British operatives communicated with Russian agents using a device concealed in a fake rock left near a Moscow park.The officials did not specify the nature of the secrets Colonel Skripal was accused of betraying, nor did they explain why his case was disclosed only at the end of his trial, though he was reportedly arrested in December 2004. But his spying was said to have caused serious, though unspecified, damage to Russia’s defense and national security.Advertisement Continue reading the main story“The damage cannot be measured in rubles or in terms of anything else,” the new chief military prosecutor, Sergei N. Fridinsky, said in televised remarks, as transcribed by the British Broadcasting Corporation. “The fact is that the interests of the Russian Federation have been damaged by the dissemination of classified information.”
