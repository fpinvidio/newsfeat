This Roman dish is simple to prepare and takes little time, perfect for a spring dinner party or a weeknight dinner for a family. Make sure the veal is pounded thin, and cook each side until just brown. Serve it warm, with a salad and a good crusty baguette. (The New York Times)Featured in: Good News: Nothing's New In Italy.
