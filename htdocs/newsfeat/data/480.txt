Here is a recipe for homemade quinine syrup, which will take the staid gin and tonic up a few notches. The syrup is made from cinchona, the bark of a shrub originally from Peru but now cultivated in various tropical climes worldwide, from which is extracted the alkaloid quinine, the original anti-malarial medication. It is available at a well-stocked herb store or, as always, online.Featured in: Case Study | Quinine Syrup.
