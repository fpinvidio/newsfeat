LOÍZA, P.R. — As government workers cleared roads obstructed by uprooted trees and repaired toppled electricity lines, residents of Puerto Rico felt some relief that the eye wall of Hurricane Irma had skirted the island on its recent rampage through the Caribbean.But while the commonwealth had largely been spared the 185-mile-an-hour gusts that had flattened its smaller island neighbors, hundreds of residents still lost their homes, at least three people died and almost 70 percent of households were plunged into darkness. The storm knocked out Puerto Rico’s fragile power grid, exposing the island’s decrepit infrastructure and raising questions about its future viability amid a worsening economic crisis.In Loíza, one of the coastal towns hit hardest by the hurricane, Javier Rivera and Lina Carrasquillo were still without power on Saturday.Water leaked into an assortment of pots and buckets they had scattered throughout the ground floor. The metal roof that once covered their second floor had blown away and crashed into a neighbor’s home. The couple had driven hours in search of generators, but they were sold out everywhere they looked.
