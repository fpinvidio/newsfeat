Making the topping ahead and letting it dry overnight will allow some of the moisture from the brown sugar to evaporate. This makes the crumbs lighter and less likely to sink into the batter. Or, if youâ€™re short on time, you can bake the topping in a 325-degree oven for 15 minutes, stirring once halfway through. Let cool before using.
