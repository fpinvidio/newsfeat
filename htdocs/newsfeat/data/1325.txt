In a closely watched case about a redistricting battle in Texas, the Supreme Court on Friday issued a per curiam opinion that added a further twist in a rushed and messy controversy. In the unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court told a three-judge district court in San Antonio to put aside redistricting plans it created and devise new maps based on those made by the Texas Legislature. And this time, the Supreme Court said, the district court must do a better job of explaining any maps it draws.Democrats need 25 seats to retake the House. As the Supreme Court noted, the census “showed an enormous increase in Texas’s population, with over four million new residents,” giving the state four new House seats. Hispanics, who tend to vote for Democrats, account for almost two-thirds of the growth; Hispanics and African-Americans together account for about three-fourths.But in the Congressional district maps drawn up by the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature, the number of districts in which minorities could elect a candidate of their choice dropped to 10 districts from the current 11, and the number of safe Republican seats rose to 26 from 21. In trying to fix this imbalance, the district court’s plan created three new districts in which minority voters would be the majority, with the Democrats possibly gaining four seats.The Legislature’s plan has not gone into effect because Texas, as a state covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act for its history of voting discrimination, must have its plan precleared by the Justice Department or by a district court in the District of Columbia. The state chose to go to that court, which is expected to rule on its plan next month. This case runs parallel to that one, with plaintiffs claiming that the same Texas plan also violates the Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits a state from denying or abridging the right to vote “on account of race or color.”At the oral argument, one justice wanted to ignore Section 5, others wanted to limit its impact on the Section 2 lawsuit, others still insisted that Section 5 could not be ignored. The justices chastised the San Antonio court for not showing enough deference to the Texas plan, but there is clear evidence that it embodies what the Justice Department in the Section 5 lawsuit calls “intentional discrimination” — and should not be allowed to prevail.
