Watch ... if you’re ready for a long, somber epic about the American dream. Before director and co-writer Francis Ford Coppola’s Oscar-winning classic came along, mob movies were fast, cheap affairs — the stuff of B movies and action potboilers and, occasionally, comedies. Here, the Corleone family’s Byzantine machinations, their attempts at legitimacy, their power struggles are all ultimately representative of one thing: the corrupting, but intoxicating nature of absolute power, and how it consumes even those who try to resist it. This is one of the signature American films of the 1970s and of “the New Hollywood,” but its virtues are surprisingly old-fashioned: It’s serious, tragic, novelistic.Skip ... if you’re tired of serious, tragic, novelistic gangster movies. “The Godfather” inspired an army of imitators, and set the stage for a decades-long romanticization of the American mobster. Its funereal somberness — complete with Marlon Brando’s now immortal performance as the cotton-mouthed Don Vito Corleone — can be a bit much. Plus, it’s quite violent, filled with shootings, beatings, a bloody horse’s head and one very graphic scene of a character being machine-gunned to pieces.
