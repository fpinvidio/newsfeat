This dish is sort of a summery tiramisù. The creamy mascarpone and ladyfinger layers in tiramisù are a natural with strawberries. But the espresso is too overbearing to match well with the sweet fruit. What to do? Swap out the liquid. Moscato d’Asti, a lightly sweet and fizzy wine, works here. Drizzle more of the wine on just before serving. It adds just the right brightness and verve.Featured in: Tiramisù That Soaks Up Wine Instead Of Coffee.
