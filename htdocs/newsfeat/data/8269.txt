President Raúl Castro of Cuba called for an end to the economic embargo of his country on Monday at the United Nations General Assembly, repeating a sentiment offered earlier in the day by President Obama.“Diplomatic relations have been restored between Cuba and the United States,” Mr. Castro declared, adding: “Now begins the long and complex process” of lifting the 53-year-old embargo.President Obama, speaking in the U.N. chamber earlier in the day, suggested that the U.S. Congress would eventually do just that.“I’m confident that our Congress will inevitably lift an embargo that should not be in place anymore,” Mr. Obama said in his own speech.
