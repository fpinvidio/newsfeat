In December, Ami Levy and her husband, Jason, left frigid Washington, D.C., for a two-week vacation in Argentina. Once there, they headed north to the Brazilian border for a couple of days, lured by Igauzu Falls.She recalls the excitement when their phonesâ€™ GPS indicated they finally were in Brazil, and the awe-inspiring walls of water, some more than 24 stories tall.And, she remembers, everywhere there were mosquitoes, leaving bites on her thigh.Back home the first week of January, Ms. Levy learned she was four weeks pregnant.Her first pregnancy had ended in miscarriage in September, so it was with some hesitation that she left for another trip, this time to Puerto Rico for a rendezvous with her aunt and sister.
