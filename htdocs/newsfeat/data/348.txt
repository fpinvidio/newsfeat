A marvel of a cocktail with an enviably colorful peerage, the Boulevardier is effectively a cross between a Manhattan and a Negroni. In colder months, it’s a magnificent drink to have as a fallback when you want something richer and more complex than just a whiskey but can never seem to think of what else to order. It’s composed of two parts American whiskey, with one part each of sweet vermouth and Campari. Taken one way, it’s a Manhattan with a portion of Campari swapped in for the regular few drops of Angostura or other aromatic bitters. Seen the other way, it’s a Negroni with whiskey in place of the gin.Featured in: Case Study | The Boulevardier.Learn: How to Make Cocktails
