This green quiche laden with herbs and with thin slices of fresh goat cheese baked on top has a Gallic rusticity. A proper quiche (also known as a tarte sal√©e, or savory open pie) should have really good pastry and contain a soft, tender eggy custard. It should be light enough to serve as a first course, or in larger portions for a simple main course. It should be something to sing about.Featured in: Quiche Goes On A Diet And Relearns French.Learn: How to Make Quiche
