This is Craig Claiborne's 1985 recreation of the shrimp remoulade served at Arnaud's, the legendary restaurant in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Fiery with horseradish and Creole mustard -- Zatarain's was the brand Claiborne recommended -- the sauce also contains finely chopped heart of celery, green onion and a splash of good oil. Paprika adds a further touch of spice and a fine red color. Claiborne recommended allowing the dish to cure overnight in the refrigerator. This remains good advice. Arnaud's shrimp remoulade, he wrote at the time, "is a pleasure that endures." (The New York Times)Featured in: Cajun And Creole: French.
