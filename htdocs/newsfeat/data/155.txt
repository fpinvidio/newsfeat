I had a hunk of butternut squash lingering in my refrigerator, and it turned out to be the perfect ingredient for a grilled cheese and vegetable sandwich. I roasted it to bring out its sweetness, and paired it with chopped fresh sage, my favorite herb to use with winter squash. The rest came together quite naturally. The sweet and earthy flavors against the salty feta are perfect. You’ll have more mashed roasted squash than you need for one sandwich. Use it in another, or freeze it for another night when you’re too tired to cook.Featured in: Grilled Cheese For Grownups.
