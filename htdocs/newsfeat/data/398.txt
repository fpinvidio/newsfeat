This thick, hearty meal is inspired by a traditional Proven√ßal harvest soup. Farro (spelt) and the softer emmer wheat are grains that were once peasant staples in the mountainous areas of Provence, though they are less common now. Traditionally, the grain is simmered with a mutton, prosciutto or ham bone. I use Parmesan rinds to enrich the flavor of this version.Featured in: Soups With Grains.Learn: How to Make Soup
