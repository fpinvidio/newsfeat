Don’t mask salmon, or cook it to bits in a hot oven. Let it shine by grilling it on a bed of kale. The technique gives you quick, crisp chips, and a soft, perfectly cooked piece of fish that won’t stick to the grill. Then smother it in herbs: basil, mint, dill, cilantro, even sorrel, if that’s what came in your farm box. You can serve this with potatoes, corn, salad or toasted bread, or any simple side you can throw together quickly.
