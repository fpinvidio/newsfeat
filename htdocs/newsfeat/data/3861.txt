So what if the United States didn’t qualify for the 2018 World Cup? In New York you can eat, drink and watch the games with the Belgians or the Brits. Or wherever there’s a TV over the bar. Here's a handy guide to help you find your inner expat.There is no shortage of French boîtes showing Les Bleus on TV. This West Village bistro will employ both a television and a projection screen, and each time France scores a goal, patrons will be treated to Champagne. A longstanding Francophone venue in Brooklyn is Bar Tabac , a Boerum Hill bistro that’s open for breakfast every day.Highbury Pub is filled to the brim whenever the North London club Arsenal has a game. Expect the same for England matches — or most matches, for that matter. This place is tiny, so when someone orders a meat pie, the aroma quickly fills the pub. Across Brooklyn in the South Slope is the Black Horse Pub , where the crowd for big games tends to spill out onto Fifth Avenue.There are very few bars in the city where you can sit with a drink for an hour and hear nothing but Croatian; this is one of them. After Scorpio Cafe closed last year, this lounge became the center of Croatian soccer in New York. Eat in advance, as there is no kitchen here. Nearby is Studio Square , a beer garden where you can expect a great Croatian turnout, and where all tournament games will be shown.BXL Zoute (“BXL” is the airport code for Brussels, Zoute is an affluent neighborhood on the North Sea) is a home base during major tournaments for fans of all stripes, not just those of the Red Devils. For the early games, get a gaufre – an authentic Belgian waffle – which pairs well with any of the Belgian beers on tap. If you are stuck in Times Square, Zoute’s sister bar, BXL Café on 43rd Street, is a fine option.Want more World Cup?

Elmhurst has been a center of Argentine culture since the 1960s. Before each match, expect boisterous crowds in the streets, with some fans adding to the celebration with homemade musical instruments.

Fans might also try El Basurero, equally rowdy, in Astoria at 32-17 Steinway Street.Costa Rica WhereBogotá Latin Bistro 141 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn When June 17: Lost to Serbia, 0-1June 22: Lost to Brazil, 0-2June 27: Tied Switzerland, 2-2 This Park Slope restaurant has added extra TVs throughout the restaurant — at the bar, in the main and side dining rooms, and on the patio — to welcome the World Cup. They’ll be showing every game, but plan to arrive early for the Latin-American matches (particularly Costa Rica and Colombia).Denmark WhereDanish Athletic Club 725-741 65th St., Sunset Park, Brooklyn When July 1: Lost to Croatia, 1-1 (2-3)June 26: Tied France, 0-0June 21: Tied Australia, 1-1June 16: Beat Peru, 1-0 It’s no surprise that this 126-year-old athletic and social club will be the viewing place of choice for Denmark fans, in a neighborhood once full of Danish immigrants.

German beer and Riesling will be served, and representatives from the Institut will be around to discuss German culture, sporting or otherwise. A rowdier option is Zum Schneider, an East Village beer garden, always packed when Germany plays.Iceland WhereBloom’s Tavern 208 East 58th Street, Manhattan When June 16: Tied Argentina, 1-1June 22: Lost to Nigeria, 2-0June 26: Lost to Croatia, 1-2 When Iceland played in Euro 2016 – making it to the quarterfinals in its first-ever major tournament appearance – the consulate organized a viewing party at this classic Irish pub. The bar is now so strongly associated with Iceland that the country’s flag has a place of honor on the ceiling. Iceland’s World Cup debut coincides with Bloomsday, the celebration of the events of James Joyce’s novel “Ulysses,” so expect a one-of-a-kind atmosphere. Reyka Vodka, Iceland’s first vodka distillery, is also sponsoring a series of events at sports bars around the city, including at Beer Authority, at 300 West 40th St., for the Croatia game.Iran WhereColbeh 32 West 39th St., Midtown Manhattan When June 15: Beat Morocco, 1-0June 20: Lost to Spain, 0-1June 25: Tied Portugal, 1-1 Colbeh might be fancier than most venues on the list, but Iranians swear by this well-established Persian restaurant, where the games will play on three 42-inch televisions.

At Canal Street Market, the restaurant shares a stall with Samurice, where it will offer $1 miso soup during Japan’s games, as well as a chicken katsu special. (Bonus trivia: Katsu means “victory” in Japanese.) Doors open 30 minutes before each Samurai Blue match. Another option is Azasu on the Lower East Side, at 49 Clinton Street.Mexico WhereCantina Rooftop 605 W 48th St., Midtown Manhattan When July 2: Lost to Brazil, 0-2June 27: Lost to Sweden, 0-3June 23: Beat South Korea, 2-1June 17: Beat Germany, 1-0 A safe bet to get a bar stool during a Mexico game is Cantina Rooftop, an enormous rooftop spot in Midtown. Or for a more authentic experience, make your way to Roosevelt Avenue in Queens, where you’ll be hard pressed to find a bar or restaurant not playing the game. But you might have hard time finding an open seat. Try Juan Bar, at 96-15 Roosevelt Avenue in Corona, which is attached to the restaurant Tortas Neza. Or watch the game at one of the four televisions at Tacos Morelos, at 94-13 37th Avenue in Jackson Heights. In Brooklyn, go for the restaurants and bars on Fourth and Fifth Avenues in Sunset Park, like Tacos El Bronco and Tacos Matamoros.Morocco WhereArabesque 4 East 36th St., Midtown Manhattan When June: Lost to Iran, 0-1June 20: Lost to Portugal, 0-1June 25: Tied Spain, 2-2 Morocco’s games will be shown on a large projection screen in the private room at this popular restaurant and bar.

Also in Brooklyn, the Afro Carib Network and Nollywood NYC are hosting a cover-free party for Nigeria’s opening match at Milk River, a two-level restaurant and lounge on Atlantic Avenue, near the Barclays Center.Panama WhereMichelle's Cocktail Lounge 2294 Bedford Avenue, Flatbush, Brooklyn When June 18: Lost to Belgium, 0-3June 24: Lost to England, 1-6June 28: Lost to Tunisia, 1-2 Michelle’s, a long-time jazz club, has recently become a popular pre-show spot since the nearby Kings Theater reopened, but it remains the local hub for all things Panamanian.Peru WhereMancora Restaurant and Bar 97 First Ave., East Village, Manhattan When June 16: Lost to Denmark, 0-1June 21: Lost to France, 0-1June 26: Beat Australia, 2-0 Famous for its ceviches and rotisserie chicken, Mancora will show the games on two 70-inch televisions.

Expect Portuguese beer specials, shrimp Mozambique and salt cod. For the more intrepid fan, there is no better spot to watch Portugal play than in Newark’s Ironbound District. In addition to the many bars and restaurants along Ferry Street, try Sport Club Portuguese, a neighborhood cultural center at 55 Prospect Street.Russia WhereRussian Baths 1200 Gravesend Neck Rd., Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn When July 7: Lost to Croatia, 2-2 (3-4)July 1: Beat Spain, 1-1 (4-3)June 25: Lost to Uruguay, 0-3June 19: Beat Egypt, 3-1June 14: Beat Saudi Arabia, 5-0 This is about as close as you’ll get to the culture of the host country without boarding a flight to Moscow.

To get in the spirit, try the Dakar chicken wings at Ponty Bistro Harlem, located at 2375 Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard.Serbia WhereKafana 116 Avenue C, East Village, Manhattan When June 17: Beat Costa Rica, 1-0June 22: Lost to Switzerland, 1-2June 27: Lost to Brazil, 0-2 Kafana, typically open afternoons and evenings only, will open at 7:30 a.m. to cheer on its squad, serving a traditional Serbian breakfast, including gibanica (cheese pie) and zeljanica (spinach pie). “Last time we beat Germany,” the owner, Vladimir Ocokoljic, said, “it was 9:30 in the morning and everyone was dancing on tables and chairs.” The German beer garden Zum Schneider is across the street, so the block will be full of energy. Another option is the Serbian Association of New York, a cultural center and social club in Glendale, Queens, at 72-54 65th Place.South Korea WhereKum Gang San 138-28 Northern Blvd., Flushing, Queens When June 18: Lost to Sweden, 0-1June 23: Lost to Mexico, 1-2June 27: Beat Germany, 2-0 The festivities at this 24-hour Korean barbecue restaurant are sponsored by the Korean Sports Association of New York, which will have an expert on hand to offer commentary and lead cheers (in Korean) for the South Korean games.

At its new West 40th Street venue, Boqueria will open its doors at 6:30 a.m. for all games, even when Spain is not playing, and breakfast will be served.Sweden WhereTonic Times Square 727 7th Ave., Midtown Manhattan When July 7: Lost to England, 0-2July 3: Beat Switzerland, 1-0June 27: Beat Mexico, 3-0June 23: Lost to Germany, 1-2June 18: Beat South Korea, 1-0 Expect a large contingent of Swedes (and Danes) at this centrally located sports bar. During the World Cup, revelers bring their own Scandinavian native food and pastries — while the bar serves a full menu and breakfast for the early-morning games. A more low-key venue is the Church of Sweden in Midtown Manhattan. Both a church and a cultural center, the institution, at 5 East 48th Street, will show the game against Germany. Coffee and cinnamon buns will be served.Switzerland WhereCafé Select 212 Lafayette St., Manhattan When July 3: Lost to Sweden, 0-1June 27: Tied Costa Rica, 2-2June 22: Beat Serbia, 2-1June 17: Tied Brazil, 1-1This festive Swiss spot in SoHo keeps Christmas lights crisscrossing its ceiling year-round.

Of all of the options on this strip, a go-to spot for Arab football fans is this nondescript Italian cafe; don’t expect to sip your macchiato in peace if a local team is playing. In general, a stroll down Steinway Street will reveal other hookah bars with flat-screen TVs, some of which might even open early for the World Cup.
