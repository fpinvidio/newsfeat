Born in 1925 in the Chicago area, Mr. Pennebaker had no early plans to go into film; he studied mechanical and electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then Yale. After graduating in 1947, he moved to the West Village and worked at a company that built power stations; the job bored him so much that he spent most of his time reading science fiction in the bathroom. He next found work with a man who shot newsreel-type footage abroad, but was bothered that he and the filmmaker had to write voice-over scripts.“I thought this could be more interesting if we filmed what people really did say,” he recalled. A few years later, he began working with Mr. Drew, Mr. Leacock and Mr. Maysles, making “Primary,” about the 1960 John F. Kennedy-Hubert H. Humphrey face-off in Wisconsin; and with Mr. Drew and Mr. Leacock, “Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment,” about Kennedy’s standoff against Gov. George C. Wallace over the integration of the University of Alabama.
