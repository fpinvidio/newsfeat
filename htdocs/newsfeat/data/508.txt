This tangy, minty smoothie may have more adult appeal than kid appeal, but it’s certainly one of my favorites. I particularly like it made with almond milk. The pineapple in this drink will give you your daily requirement for manganese, and it’s a good source of vitamins C, B1, B6, copper and dietary fiber.Featured in: Want More Fruit?
