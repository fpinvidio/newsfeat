Kanye West is coming back with a vengeance — and two new albums.The rapper, who had been largely quiet in public since a dramatic spiral near the end of 2016 — during which he canceled a major tour, was hospitalized for a “psychiatric emergency” and angered some fans by meeting with then-President-elect Donald J. Trump before going dark — re-emerged recently on Twitter and in photos with his most frequent musical collaborators, stoking anticipation for a new release.On Thursday, Mr. West, 40, confirmed the whispers in his trademark off-the-cuff fashion, posting on Twitter, “my album is 7 songs,” followed two minutes later by a date: June 1.That was not all. Mr. West also announced a second album in collaboration with his on-again, off-again associate Kid Cudi due out June 8, according to his tweets: “it’s called Kids See Ghost,” Mr. West wrote. “That’s the name of our group.”
