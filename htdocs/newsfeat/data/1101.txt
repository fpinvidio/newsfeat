And on a market visit the other day, fresh asparagus seemed to be popping out all over. There were tempting green spears in every size — fat, medium and pencil-thin, and even some purple-tinged varieties.So of course, it is asparagus this week for the City Kitchen column.Though asparagus can be refrigerated for up to a few days, for the best flavor I suggest buying just enough for the meal you are serving. Freshly cut asparagus really does tastes sweeter; all the more reason to buy it locally and frequently. The question is, how much?If it is to be served as a first course, a one-pound bunch can make four modest portions. (There are usually 12 fat spears, 16 medium spears or 36 skinny spears to a pound.) I call for a pound and a half in this week’s recipes, but true asparagus fanatics may want more. It’s nice to have a few extra on hand to enhance a breakfast omelette or frittata.
