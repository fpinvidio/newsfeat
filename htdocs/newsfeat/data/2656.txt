HONG KONG — Dennis Rodman apologized Thursday for comments suggesting that an American jailed in North Korea deserved his fate. Rodman said he had been drinking at the time.Rodman, who is visiting North Korea, has come under sharp criticism because of the positive statements he has made about the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, while largely ignoring the nation’s abysmal human rights record.That criticism intensified after Rodman discussed North Korea’s detention of Kenneth Bae, an American missionary, in a rambling CNN interview on Wednesday. Asked whether he would bring up Bae’s fate during his trip, Rodman said, “If you understand what Kenneth Bae did.”He added: “Do you understand what he did in this country? And — no, no, no, you tell me. You tell me. Why is he held captive here in this country? Why?”
