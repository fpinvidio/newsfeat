For this sandwich, you can also pan-fry the mushrooms, which give this sandwich a somewhat meaty quality. But in this case I used the toaster oven to roast the mushrooms. You’ll need only half of the roasted mushrooms for 1 sandwich but you’ll find a good use for the rest of them, I’m sure.Featured in: Grilled Cheese For Grownups.
