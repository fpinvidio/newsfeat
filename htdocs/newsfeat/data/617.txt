The success of this delectably simple weeknight pasta relies on two things: the quality of the bacon, and the sheer amount of freshly ground pepper. The bacon must have ample fat to render out (this is where the sauciness comes from) as well as a hearty, smoky flavor. As for the black pepper, more is more; getting enough of that subtle, floral spiciness will require more than a few turns from the grinder. And yes, there's an egg on top.
