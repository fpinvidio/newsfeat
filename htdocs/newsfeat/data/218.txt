Mushrooms are the most versatile of ingredients, with a meaty texture and a rich, deep flavor ideal for vegetarian dishes. When raw, they’re elegant and delicious; when cooked, they become substantial. They are as welcome in a classic French omelet as they are in an Asian stir-fry. Mushrooms also are a nutritional bargain. Two ounces of sliced white mushrooms — about a cup — contain only 15 calories, and they are among the best dietary sources of B vitamins. Best of all, there are just so many mushroom dishes to try. This savory omelet is great for dinner or for brunch. If I’m making it for two, I make one large omelet in a 10-inch pan. It’s just as easy as making two individual omelets, and both servings are ready at the same time.Featured in: Mushrooms: The Flavor Of The Dark.Learn: How to Cook EggsLearn: How to Make an Omelet
