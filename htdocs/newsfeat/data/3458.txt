Credit New Jersey State PoliceMr. Rahami, who previously served time in jail, was born in Afghanistan but is a United States citizen. He lived above the fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, N.J., started by his father, Mohammad, and also worked there.Some of his friends called him Mad — apparently a reference to his first name, not his demeanor — and he was known for an obsession with souped-up Honda Civics that he liked to race.After the bombing, the authorities sent what’s being called an unprecedented cellphone alert to area residents, warning of the manhunt for a suspect. Mr. Rahami was found asleep in a doorway of a bar in New Jersey on Monday, and the police were called.After a gunfight with officers, during which he was shot multiple times — including in the leg and shoulder — he was taken into custody and treated at University Hospital in Newark. An officer was hit in his vest in the area of his abdomen, officials said, and at least one other officer was hurt.Mr. Rahami was charged in federal court with several crimes, including the use of weapons of mass destruction and bombing a place of public use. He was previously charged with seven counts, including five counts of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer. His bail was set at $5.2 million.
