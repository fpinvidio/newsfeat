The migrant crisis in Europe has been greatly complicated by the Continent’s incomplete integration, as national interests and political attitudes toward the newcomers have clashed with Europewide policies and initiatives that have been among the Continent’s most significant political achievements.Two policies that loom large in the crisis are often obscured by the opaque bureaucratic shorthand that European leaders use to refer to them: “Schengen” and the “Dublin Regulation.” Here they are in a nutshell.— PATRICK J. LYONSWhat is Schengen?It is an agreement to abolish border controls among the European nations that have joined. For the most part, people in any Schengen country can travel freely to any other without stopping to show a passport or visa, just as travelers can between American states or Canadian provinces. Only when entering from outside the Schengen area are a traveler’s credentials regularly checked.Where did the name come from?It is named for the town in Luxembourg where the original agreement was signed in 1985. The Schengen area began with just five countries and was set up separately from the European Union, but it was incorporated into the union’s 1997 Amsterdam Treaty with provisions for some nations to “opt out.”
