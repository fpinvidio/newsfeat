I usually keep a good supply of arborio rice on hand for risotto, but on the day I first decided to make this I had just about run out. So I cooked up some short-grain brown rice and stirred it in toward the end of cooking, and what resulted was a wholesome mixed-grains risotto. You won’t get the creaminess if you use all brown rice (and it will take forever), but if you want some whole grain, use the combination option.Featured in: One More Reason To Love Mussels: Curry Laced Moules à La Marinière With Fresh Peas.
