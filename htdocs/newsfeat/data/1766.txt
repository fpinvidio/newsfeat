Lara Miranda, 31, an administrator at Hunter College, and her husband, Steven Moran, 35, a waiter, spent four years living with a relative in Harlem, but earlier this year, with a second child on the way, they began searching for a place of their own. “Looking in Harlem and Upper Manhattan,” she said, “we realized we were not going to afford a two-bedroom there.”They visited Parkchester, a 129-acre planned community in the eastern Bronx, where Ms. Miranda admired an apartment rented by friends. She decided on the spot that the huge complex was for them.The grounds were well kept, the No. 6 subway train was there to take them to their jobs in Manhattan, playgrounds for their 5-year-old daughter were numerous, and the sidewalks were filled with young families like theirs, Ms. Miranda said.On Sept. 1, a month after their second daughter was born, the family moved into a two-bedroom rental, paying $1,605 a month.
