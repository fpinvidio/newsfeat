Frozen conch is available from the odd fishmonger as frozen steaks or scungilli, but you will have a better chance of finding it in your local Chinatown. (Abalone is an acceptable, but expensive, substitute; you can also use clams.) Should you wish to prepare the conch in any way other than ground, you will have to beat it with a mallet until it and, quite likely, you, are falling apart.
