I set out to make something more like a sherbet, a mango lassi ice. I calculated the amount of sweetening needed for the right texture and flavor in a blend of buttermilk and mango. As a general rule, the sugar in fruit ice should be 15 to 20 percent of the weight of the fruit. This time, I used honey instead of sugar. The result is a creamy, tangy sherbet.Featured in: Mango Ice Means Summer Is Now.
