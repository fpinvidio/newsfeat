I use pesto and pistou in many other dishes besides pasta. Pesto is a nutritionally dense condiment; basil is a great source of flavonoids that are believed to have antioxidant and antibacterial properties. It’s also an excellent source of vitamin K, and a very good source of iron, calcium and vitamin A. Purists will only use a mortar and pestle for pesto. I like the results I get using a hand blender inside a straight-sided jar. As long as you make the full batch, this is the best machine to use, as it purées the basil much more efficiently than a food processor.Featured in: A Surfeit Of Pesto.
