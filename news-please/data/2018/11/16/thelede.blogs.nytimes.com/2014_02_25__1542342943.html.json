They also used Twitter and other social media platforms to urge people to build barricades across Venezuela and then share photos of them.\n.\nJust this month, nearly one million posts on Twitter have used the hashtag #24FGranBarricadaNacional to help organize the conversation about the unrest.\nIn this video, shot through a window and uploaded onto YouTube, armed members of the government can be seen assembling outside of a barricade amid gun shots fired. At one point, they encounter a female demonstrator.\nOn Monday, the protests shut down San Cristóbal, a city of 260,000, as my Mr. Neuman, my colleague, reports.\nIn Caracas, the capital, and in other cities, people created barricades with furniture and tree limbs to block roads in what Mr. Neuman describes as a “coordinated action against the government.”\nScenes of the barricades in San Cristóbal were shared widely online.\nSAN CRISTÓBAL.
