Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to help us explain what, exactly, all the fuss was about.\nSince we are in the blogging business, the reader who submits the most useful links to news articles on other Web sites that put the photograph into context will be declared the winner.\nSeveral readers very quickly defied our expectation that this might be a tough one by answering correctly and supplying us with a variety of excellent links to articles, blog posts, photographs and even a video report in the comments thread below. Thanks and congratulations all round.", "url": "https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/22/photo-quiz-giant-garland-edition/"}
