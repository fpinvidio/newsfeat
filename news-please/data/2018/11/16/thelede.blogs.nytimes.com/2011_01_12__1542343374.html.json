On Tuesday, after Agence France-Presse reported that two people were killed in Douz, the Nawaat bloggers uploaded an extremely graphic clip showing the body of a man they identify as a university professor, “shot by the Tunisian government police’s snipers today during the protest in the southern city of Douz.”\nOne day earlier, the Nawaat bloggers posted video of a clash in the city of Kasserine on Monday. It shows protesters retreating from what sounds like gunfire. Information posted with the clip suggested that four people were killed in six minutes in this area.\nOn Tuesday, after visiting Sidi Bouzid, where the demonstrations started last month, the blogger Lina Ben Mhenni posted images and a first-hand account of the situation in Kasserine on her blog A Tunisian Girl.\nAmong the blogger’s photographs was one of local lawyers engaged in a sit-in on the steps of the city’s court house, “against the use of live ammunition during demonstrations.”\nOn Monday, Nawaat also uploaded video of students in Tunis spelling out the Arabic word for “Freedom.”\nAn Al Jazeera report on the protests on Sunday included several YouTube clips of previous demonstrations and clashes:\nAl Jazeera’s report also showed part of a viral video by a Tunisian rapper, Hamada Ben-Amor, known as The General. After Mr. Ben-Amor, who is 22, was arrested at his home in Sfax last week, his brother told Al Jazeera: “Some 30 plainclothes policemen came to our house to arrest Hamada and took him away without ever telling us where to. When we asked why they were arresting him, they said, ‘he knows why.'”\nLast week Mr. Ben-Amor posted a rap video online, “President, Your People are Dying,” that begins with a clip of the country’s authoritarian president, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.\nThe president was also undermined by a viral YouTube clip last month, when Tunisian bloggers recorded and shared part of his televised, live address to the nation on the crisis, which was interrupted by a ringing telephone.\n*An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that the Tunisian blogger Slim Amamou had used FourSquare instead of Google Latitude to signal his location.", "url": "https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/tunisians-document-protests-online/"}
