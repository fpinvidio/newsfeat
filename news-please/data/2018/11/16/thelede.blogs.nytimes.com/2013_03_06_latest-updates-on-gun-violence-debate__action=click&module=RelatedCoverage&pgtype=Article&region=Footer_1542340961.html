<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But as the Senate returns from recess next week to debate federal legislation that includes extending background checks, some state lawmakers are looking to expand rights of gun owners and loosen regulations governing purchases. </p>

Gov. Gary Herbert <a href="//www.abc4.com/content/news/top_stories/story/Governor-Herbert-vetoes-bill-relaxing-Utah-s/RpV8-EvDLkWDybjTR1YbXg.cspx">decided to veto t</a>he legislation, saying that the requirement for a concealed weapons permit did not hinder anyone&#8217;s rights.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Malloy was joined at the bill signing ceremony with family members who lost loved ones, including 20 small children, in the mass shooting on Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Mr. Malloy broke the news about the deaths of 20 children and six educators to parents and family members waiting in the town&#8217;s firehouse that day. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;This is a profoundly emotional day, I think, for everyone in this room and everyone watching what is transpiring today in the state of Connecticut,&#8221;  Mr. Malloy said </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Under the new laws, Connecticut has expanded its ban on assault weapons, prohibited the sale of high-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 bullets, required gun owners to register assault rifles and other ammunition and extend background checks, making it more difficult for people with a history of mental illness to purchase a gun. Most of the law&#8217;s provisions will take effect on August 1, the governor said, but some aspects of the law go into effect right away.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The legislation was approved by the House early Thursday morning, as our colleague Peter Applebome <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/nyregion/connecticut-lawmakers-pass-gun-limits.html?ref=peterapplebome">reported,</a>  after it was approved by the Senate on Wednesday. </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As our colleague, Peter Applebome <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/nyregion/connecticut-lawmakers-pass-gun-limits.html?pagewanted=all">reported</a>, &#8220;the vote came in a deeply divided Capitol packed with angry and frustrated gun owners who arrived in buses and vans carrying signs reading “Connecticut the Un-Constitution State,” “N.R.A.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, said he would  sign the legislation at a ceremony scheduled for noon on Thursday. The package of bills include restrictions on the sale of high-capacity magazines, expanding the number of weapons covered under the state&#8217;s existing assault weapons band, extending background checks, limiting gun sales to people with mental illness and requiring gun owners to register weapons with high-capacity magazines. </p>

<div class="caption">Colorado county sheriffs object to new state laws restricting gun owners and gun purchases.</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A few hours before President Obama spoke at a police academy in Colorado, as our colleague Michael D. Shear <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/us/politics/in-state-that-knows-the-gun-debate-the-president-urges-both-sides-to-listen.html?ref=michaeldshear">reported,</a> to draw attention to the state&#8217;s newly approved restrictions on guns, more than a dozen of the state&#8217;s county sheriffs gathered at a nearby park a few hours earlier to sharply criticize  the new laws.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The nation&#8217;s police chiefs have been a key component of Mr. Obama&#8217;s lobbying effort for tougher federal gun measures and the state&#8217;s police chief&#8217;s organization supported Colorado&#8217;s newly signed legislation that extends background checks to private gun sales and limits the sale of high-capacity magazines. But several of Colorado&#8217;s sheriffs, speaking Wednesday, at a news conference said that the new laws would do little to avert another mass shooting and impose unnecessary restrictions on gun owners.. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And they complained that the state lawmakers and the governor did not listen to their concerns.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“If the issue that we’re focusing on is community safety and reducing violence, it could have been done without some of these very serious impositions on our citizens,” said Justin Smith, Larimer County Sheriff. “The fact they ignored that and the president showed up for a victory lap, I think, is a slap in the face to Coloradans.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Terry Maketa, the sheriff from El Paso County, said the new laws &#8220;criminalize law-abiding citzens.&#8221; He cited a provision that bans sales of gun magazines that can hold more than 15 rounds. The new law would allow people to keep a magazine that can hold more than 15 rounds but face a misdemeanor charge if they sold it or gave it away.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;These laws will haven no deterrent effect whatsoever on the tragedy that occurred in Aurora,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At a police academy, surrounded by law enforcement officers, community leaders and family members who lost loved ones to gun violence, President Obama <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO_dUo0M6OU">praised</a> the state&#8217;s lawmakers and Gov. John W. Hickenlooper for approving what he called &#8220;common-sense&#8221; gun legislation.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Colorado has experienced two of the nation&#8217;s worst mass shootings, in 1999 at Columbine High School and last summer at a suburban Denver movie theater.  At the law signing ceremony, the sister of one of the 12 people who died in the movie theater, where 70 others were wounded,  said she believed the law banning the sale of high capacity magazines could have saved her brother and other victims. Now, a state known for its staunch support for sportsmen and the Second Amendment, Colorado has the tightest restrictions on gun owners and gun purchases outside of New York, Connecticut and other northeastern states. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In his remarks, Mr. Obama emphasized the importance of universal background checks.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-hide-thread"><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Obama: &#8220;If you want to buy a gun—whether from a licensed dealer or a private seller—you should at least have to pass a background check.&#8221;</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Governor Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut said that he would sign into law the bipartisan package of new gun measures that the state&#8217;s lawmakers are expected to approve on Wednesday, <a href="//www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-gun-bill-tough-0403-20130402,0,693207.story">The Hartford Courant reports.</a></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;I think it demonstrates once again that we can do things on a bipartisan basis in Connecticut that simply can&#8217;t be gotten done in Washington or other state capitals,&#8221; Governor Malloy said at a news conference.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Describing Connecticut&#8217;s package of bills the most restrictive in the nation, the National Rifle Association <a href="//nraila.org/legislation/state-legislation/2013/4/connecticut-most-restrictive-gun-control-bill-in-the-nation-to-">urged members </a> to travel to Hartford to protest the bills that were still being debated Wednesday afternoon. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Malloy initially wanted a statewide ban on high-capacity magazines, similar to a law enacted in New York. The package of bills include extending background checks, banning the purchase of new high-capacity magazines and other measures intended to strengthen school security and address mental health concerns.  &#8220;It is a very strong statement to the rest of the country,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When asked about threats from gun makers leaving the state because of the new legislation, Mr. Malloy said that he thought about jobs all the time as a governor but his primary concern was safety. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When asked about concerns from gun owners over imposing new restrictions, which they view as unnecessary, he told reporters:</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;There are weapons that are inherently more dangerous than others. When you can walk into a school and kill 20 children and six adults in less than five minutes and get off 154 rounds in that school, that is a dangerous weapon. Interestingly enough, we have had an assault weapons ban in 1992. But it was drafted in such a way that you could drive a truck through those loopholes. Those loopholes are now closed.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The vote comes three months after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 20 children and six educators dead in Newtown, Conn.,  and amid a national debate over whether stricter gun measures are needed to help avoid further gun violence.<a href="//www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/us/politics/in-state-that-knows-the-gun-debate-the-president-urges-both-sides-to-listen.html?ref=us">President Obama</a> is expected to visit Connecticut early next week as part of his campaign to press members of Congress to approve new gun restrictions. The Senate is expected to consider limited restrictions next week. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Meanwhile, the expectation of new limits on gun purchases and ammunition prompted a surge of new sales and activity at Connecticut&#8217;s gun shops, as our colleague, Peter Applebome, <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/nyregion/connecticut-prepares-for-consequences-of-new-gun-laws.html?ref=nyregion&#038;_r=0">reports. </a></p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He also said that he believed that concern about mental health issues needed to be addressed.  &#8220;If you look what took place in Sandy Hook, mental health is a huge component of that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The recommendations include a call for schools to develop &#8220;a threat assessment team, which will work in coordination with mental health professionals.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> &#8220;The purpose is to create a positive school environment that encourages sharing information on early warning signs and reducing incidences of bullying or other anti- social behavior,&#8221; according to the report.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>Other excerpts from the National Rifle Association&#8217;s recommendations on school safety:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">No. 1: Training:  A model-training program has been developed by the NSS Task Force for the professional training of armed personnel in the school environment&#8230;.This training will only be open to those who are designated by school officials and qualified by appropriate background investigation, testing and relevant experience.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The National School Shield initiative should adopt this model-training program for armed officers or personnel in the schools as a best practice. The N.R.A. has the nationally recognized expertise to develop and implement the stringent training courses required by this model program. It is recommended that the professional training programs that are approved by the states for armed school personnel use private sector approved and certified trainers as well as traditional state law enforcement trainers. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">No. 2: Adoption of Model Law for Armed School Personnel: Many states prohibit anyone other than a sworn law-enforcement officer or licensed security guard to carry a firearm in a public or non-public school. In order for a selected school staff member to be designated, trained and armed on school property, the states will have to change current legal restrictions.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">No. 3: School Resource Officer: Each school that employs an S.R.O. should have a Memorandum of Understanding (M.O.U.), or an “interagency agreement,” between the appropriate law-enforcement agency and the school district. This contract should define the duties and responsibilities of the SRO, as well as the applicable laws, rules and regulations. The objective of the S.R.O. is not to increase juvenile arrests within a school, but to provide security and to support the normal disciplinary policies of a school consistent with the M.O.U.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">No. 4: Online Self-Assessment Tool: An internet-based self-assessment tool has been created to allow any school (whether public, private or parochial) to have secure access to comprehensively evaluate and assess the security gaps and vulnerabilities of each school. The National School Shield initiative should pilot this self-assessment tool in three school districts of different sizes in order to perfect the questions and scoring. After the pilot projects are completed, this assessment tool should be deployed in a secure fashion on the N.S.S. Web site for free access by all schools who obtain authorization codes.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">No. 5: State Education Adequacy Requirement: State standards related to school security vary from non-existent to stringent. Although state responses to school security will naturally vary, there should be a common element that requires all public schools to participate in an assessment and develop a security plan based on the unique requirements of that particular institution.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">No. 6: Federal Coordination and Funding: Either through legislation or executive action, a lead agency should be designated to coordinate the federal programs and funding of local school safety efforts. The Department of Homeland Security should be designated as the lead, supported by the Department of Education and Department of Justice. It is recommended that the Department of Homeland Security grants should be open for school security programs such as training, risk assessment and security response planning. This would not involve any additional federal funds, but would open up schools as a potential recipient of the Homeland Security grants.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">No. 7: Umbrella National Organization to Advocate and Support School Safety:  Because of the limitations of federal, state and local funding for school safety, there is an<br />
important role that can be filled by a private non-profit advocacy and education organization. The National School Shield is in a position with adequate funding and support from the N.R.A. to fulfill this important national mission. The N.S.S. mission would: (a) provide national advocacy for school safety; (b) supply ongoing online self-assessment and other tools for public, private and parochial schools; (c) make available best practices in school safety to help guide schools in the development of school safety and security policies; (d) fund innovative pilot projects and training costs for armed school personnel; and (e) provide state-of-the-art training programs in the area of school safety and security.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">No. 8: Specific Pilot Program on Threat Assessments and Mental Health. As part of its comprehensive security plan, each school should develop a threat assessment team, which will work in coordination with mental health professionals. The purpose is to create a positive school environment that encourages sharing information on early warning signs and reducing incidences of bullying or other anti- social behavior. The team should coordinate with any current crisis response protocols, and should be responsible for assessing the emotional climate of the school by reviewing all relevant policies, rules and regulations that affect the educational environment. The team will be responsible for evaluating all threats, including the surrounding circumstances, and conducting an investigation to determine whether the threat is serious. After all appropriate assessments have been made, the team should create a written safety plan by integrating all relevant findings, and should determine whether to refer the student to a school psychologist for a mental health assessment and, if necessary, to the school resource officer for a law-enforcement investigation.</p>

<div class="caption">Television news report on Connecticut lawmakers reaching agreement on new gun measures</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Connecticut lawmakers are expected to vote Wednesday on what they described as some of the toughest gun laws in the country that would include extending background checks to private gun sales and expanding  the state&#8217;s assault weapons ban.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As our colleague, Peter Applebome <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/nyregion/connecticut-legislators-agree-on-far-reaching-gun-control.html?nl=nyregion&#038;emc=edit_ur_20130402&#038;pagewanted=print">reports</a>, the package of new laws include a ban on the ammunition magazine that was used to kill 20 children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School.  The legislative agreement also would require gun buyers to obtain a new state-issued certificate before purchasing any rifle, shotgun or ammunition. To get a certificate, buyers would need to be fingerprinted, take a firearms training course, undergo national criminal background check and a review to determine whether they had been committed on an involuntary or voluntary basis to a psychiatric hospital.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Despite a dramatic plea from relatives of victims killed at Sandy Hook, as Mr. Applebome notes, the legislation did not include a complete ban on high-capacity magazines, although it did include a halt on future sales of high-capacity magazines with more than 10 bullets. In New York, lawmakers and Governor Cuomo approved a bill that would ban ownership of high-capacity magazines that goes into effect next January.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I wake up in the morning and put this green ribbon and pin on my jacket lapel to remember those we’ve lost,” said John McKinney, a Republican who represents Newtown and is the Senate minority leader. “And what I’m proud of is that all of us, Republicans and Democrats, understood that some issues, and this one particularly, should rise above politics.”</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">     With the United States Senate expected to consider new gun measures after the Easter recess, gun control advocates are hoping the words of former President Reagan will help build support for expanding background checks to private gun shows and sales.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A group,  based in Alabama, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5ZULLbEwMY">released a video Friday </a>with footage of the attempted assassination of Mr. Reagan and then quotes the former president&#8217;s support in favor of background checks  in a <a href="//www.nytimes.com/1991/03/29/opinion/why-i-m-for-the-brady-bill.html">1991 op-ed, published in The New York Times</a> in favor of the Brady bill.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;President Reagan believed something could have prevented the attack,&#8221; says the narrator of the video. &#8220;Ten years later, he wrote the attack might never have happened if a bill requiring background checks had been law.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The ad was uploaded by what appears to be a recently formed group, calling itself the <a href="//www.un-ra.com/">United Network of Rational Americans.</a> The activist behind the organization is Scott Crider, the  same person who created<a href="https://www.facebook.com/DogsAgainstRomney"> &#8220;Dogs Against Romney</a>&#8221; an online effort waged against Mitt Romney during the 2012 campaign. The goal was to draw attention to how the Mr. Romney&#8217;s dog traveled on the roof of the car during a family vacation. A Facebook page devoted to this effort has more than 100,000 likes and is now being used to promote the online video promoting background checks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It was 32 years ago this week that John Hinckley Jr. shot President Reagan, Jim Brady and others. The ad notes that Mr. Reagan, who suffered a punctured lung, was shot despite the presence of armed Secret Service agents and police. Mr. Brady was paralyzed.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the op-ed, President Reagan praises the legislation requiring  a background check on individuals who purchase weapons from a federally licensed dealer. Under the legislation being considered in the Senate, background checks would be extended to gun shows and private gun purchases.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Standing with a group of mothers who lost their children to gun violence, President Obama said Thursday that tears for gun victims in Newtown and elsewhere were not enough and called on Americans to urge their lawmakers to adopt new gun laws.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Tears aren’t enough,” he said. “Expressions of sympathy aren’t enough. Speeches aren’t enough. We’ve cried enough. We’ve known enough heartbreak.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In his remarks, Mr. Obama expressed irritation at the notion that his administration had not acted swiftly enough and that the horror of what happened in Newtown had faded. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Less than 100 days ago that happened, and the entire country was shocked and the entire country pledged we would do something about it and this time would be different,” Mr. Obama said.  “Shame on us if we’ve forgotten. I haven’t forgotten those kids. Shame on us if we’ve forgotten.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“The notion that two months or three months after something as horrific as what happened in Newtown happens and we’ve moved on to other things?” he said. “That’s not who we are. That’s not who we are. And I want to make sure every American is listening today.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“We need everybody to remember how we felt 100 days ago and make sure that what we said at that time wasn’t just a bunch of platitudes, that we meant it,” he added. To lawmakers, he said, “Don’t get squishy because time has passed and maybe it’s not on the news every single day.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">An advocacy group led by Mr. Bloomberg and the mayor of Boston, Thomas M. Menino, said it was convening 120 events across the nation in support of gun measures. The group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, also broadcast ads in Connecticut featuring relatives of Sandy Hook victims calling for expanded background checks and other measures.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Obama failed to persuade his own party’s leader in the Senate to include an assault weapon ban in the gun measure being sent to the floor. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, refused to include the ban, although he has said he will allow supporters to offer it as an amendment with an up-or-down vote. Supporters acknowledge they do not have enough votes to pass it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, is preparing his own bill as an alternative to Mr. Reid’s measure, Politico reported. Mr. Grassley supported school safety measures and tougher penalties for straw purchases but opposed the assault weapon ban and the expanded background checks.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">While the gun debate is stalled in Washington, governors and state lawmakers around the country are taking up measures  similar to what President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. have proposed, including an expansion of background checks and limits on the amount of ammunition loaded into a rifle. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Appearing on <a href="//www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32545640" title="Morning Joe ">MSNBC&#8217;s Morning Joe</a> on Wednesday, Delaware&#8217;s Gov.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;But so many folks in Washington just don&#8217;t want to hear it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are hopeful that in Dover, Delaware, it will be a different situation.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On Thursday, Mr. Markell said the state&#8217;s General Assembly is expected to vote on legislation that would extend background checks to private sales and he acknowledged it wasn&#8217;t going to be easy winning passage of gun measures, even with overwhelming public support for background checks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;It  doesn&#8217;t sound so bad making sure you&#8217;re checking things out before somebody gets a weapon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The other side immediately says you&#8217;re infringing on our Second Amendment rights.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Markell echoed concerns during the interview of some gun rights advocates, <a href="//www.politico.com/story/2013/03/did-washington-wait-too-long-on-gun-control-89359.html" title="Politico">as reported by Politico</a> that, the window for winning passage of new gun restrictions may have passed four months after the shooting in Newtown. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Many of us thought after Sandy Hook, Connecticut, that the moment was right to focus on some really common-sense proposals,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not clear that it&#8217;s shaking out that way.&#8221; </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">  Just days after Senate leaders said they would not bring the proposed assault weapons ban to the floor for a vote, the mayor, the vice president and the parents whose children died in Newtown gathered at New York&#8217;s City Hall to call on politicians to take action.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Bloomberg noted that thousands of people had died as a result of gun violence since the Newtown mass shooting. &#8220;It is up to us to convince members of Congress to act now,&#8221; he said.<!--more--></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Biden called on members of Congress to think about Newtown as they weighed their decision on various gun measures, ranging from universal background checks to an assault weapons ban. “For all those who say we shouldn’t and can’t ban assault weapons, for all those who say the politics are too hard, how can they say that?” Mr. Biden said.  “You take a look at those 20 beautiful babies, and what happened, and those 6 teachers and administrators.”</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Why do people own firearms? In 1999, people cited hunting, target shooting and other activities as the top reasons for owning a firearm. Now they say that protection is the main reason they own a gun, <a href="//www.people-press.org/2013/03/12/why-own-a-gun-protection-is-now-top-reason/">according to a new poll</a> by the <a href="//www.pewresearch.org/">Pew Research Center</a> released on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The poll, conducted in mid-February of 1,504 adults across the country, found that 48 percent of gun owners said they owned a firearm for protection while 32 percent said their main reason for owning a gun was for hunting. A significant shift has taken place since 1999, when an ABC News and Washington Post poll found that 26 percent of gun owners interviewed said they owned a gun for protection, while 49 percent cited hunting.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Meanwhile, non-gun owners reported that safety was a main reason for not owning a gun. The poll noted that 39 percent said that accidents involving a firearm was their biggest concern. Nearly 58 percent of those in households without guns volunteered that they would be uncomfortable having a gun in their homes. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Over all, 57 percent of Americans said they did not have a gun in their household. Nearly a quarter of Americans said they owned a gun, rifle or pistol while  another 13 percent said another person in their household had a gun. There are more gun owners in rural than suburban and urban areas. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As reported in previous polls, 54 percent said they believed that stricter gun laws would reduce the number of deaths caused by mass shootings, while 43 percent said new laws would not make a difference.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">(Earlier on Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a measure to extend background checks to private gun sales. The committee is expected to consider a proposal to reinstate a ban on assault weapons later this week.) </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the same time, 58 percent of those polled agreed that new restrictive gun laws would make it more difficult for people to protect their homes and families; 39 percent disagreed that new laws would leave their families with less protection.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The share of American households with guns has declined over the past four decades, a national survey shows, with some of the most surprising drops in the South and the Western mountain states, where guns are deeply embedded in the culture. </p>

</div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">After more than 12 hours of emotional and bitterly divided debate, a Democratic-controlled Colorado state Senate committee gave preliminary approval to a package of gun bills on Friday. <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/us/colorado-senate-advances-strict-gun-control-measures.html">As my colleague Jack Healy reports</a>, the package includes measures that would require universal background checks for private gun sales and limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Other measures would create a fee for background checks; require those convicted of domestic abuse to surrender their firearms; and require residents applying for permits to carry concealed weapons to take in-person training classes, outlawing the handful of online-only courses now offered in the state.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If the bills win final approval — they must now survive a recorded vote from lawmakers next week — they would be Colorado’s first new firearms restrictions in more than a decade. Their passage in a state with a deep history and culture of hunting, sport shooting and gun ownership would also represent a significant victory for gun control advocates.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a new study, researchers from <a href=" //www.childrenshospital.org/">Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital</a> found that states with the most gun laws also had the fewest gun-related deaths from homicides and suicides.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But the <a href="//archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1661390">research, which was published online</a> in <a href="//archinte.jamanetwork.com/journal.aspx">JAMA Internal Medicine</a> on Wednesday, raises as many questions as it answers and is unlikely to have a significant effect on the debate taking place on new gun measures in state capitals and in Washington.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Based on a state-by-state analysis of gun laws and gun-related homicides and suicides from 2007 to 2010,  the researchers concluded that fewer people died of gun-related homicide and suicide in those states with the most restrictions and state laws governing guns. The study used data on gun deaths from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and on gun laws gathered by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, an advocacy group for stricter gun measures. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Of the 122,000 deaths studied, 60 percent were suicides. States with the most laws had a 37 percent lower rate of suicides by gun and a 40 percent lower rate of homicides than states with the least number of laws, the study said. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As my colleague Sabrina Tavernise<a href="//www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/us/to-lower-suicide-rates-new-focus-turns-to-guns.html?pagewanted=all"> reported</a>,  the high rates of suicides are in states with the highest gun ownership rates. Wyoming, Montana and Alaska, the states with the three highest suicide rates, are also the top gun-owning states, according to a Harvard analysis. She reported that &#8220;most researchers say the weight of evidence from multiple studies is that guns in the home increase the risk of suicide.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Advocates for gun rights point to Chicago and Washington and argue that strict restrictions on guns have not reduced gun violence. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Dr. Eric Fleegler, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Boston Children’s Hospital, <a href="//bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2013/03/06/states-with-strictest-firearm-laws-have-lowest-rates-gun-deaths-boston-children-hospital-study-finds/fqTVlmioqukwRLHJ84M6jP/story.html">told The Boston Globe </a> that his study did not examine city-level laws. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But he insisted that the research indicates that gun laws work. “In states with the most laws, we found a dramatic decreased rate in firearm fatalities, though we can’t say for certain that these laws have led to fewer deaths,” said Dr. Fleegler, who is also a member of the advocacy group<a href="//www.drsforamerica.org/"> Doctors for America</a>, which has urged President Obama and Congress to adopt new gun measures.</p>

Martin O&#8217;Malley that would impose a ban on the sale of assault weapons, limit the size of magazines and require new gun registration requirements. The measures would  strengthen what are already some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The state Senate voted last Thursday to approve a modified version of Mr. O&#8217;Malley&#8217;s bill, which prompted an outcry by supporters of gun rights.

The Sun <a href="//articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-03-02/news/bs-md-gun-rally-friday-20130301_1_gun-rights-gun-control-strong-gun-laws">reported </a>that 1,300 signed up to testify, mostly against the legislation, with some people waiting until after 3 a.m. to have their say. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Under the proposal, residents would be required to obtain a license and provide fingerprints before buying a handgun. Owners of guns that fall within the definition of an assault weapon would not be required to give up their gun but would need to register it with the Maryland State Police. Guns bought outside the state would need to meet registration requirements within 30 days.</p>

The new laws reduced the size of gun magazines to 7 rounds, from 10 and broadened the ban on assault weapons, including adding a requirement that people who currently own assault weapons register them with the state by April 15, 2014. The laws also impose more restrictions on people who are mentally ill seeking to obtain guns.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The father of a 6-year-old boy who was among the 20 children shot and killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., wept openly as he asked lawmakers to support a ban on assault weapons during his testimony Wednesday before a Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">    Last night, in the first congressional election since the tragedy in Newtown, another city torn apart by gun violence sent an unmistakable message: We expect Congress to act now.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">    Chicago candidate Robin Kelly made universal background checks and other critical legislation the centerpiece of her campaign, and created a model for how we can elect candidates who share our values while sending a message to members of Congress who resist commonsense solutions to reduce gun violence.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">    For decades, focusing on local issues and officials is how the NRA exerted so much influence over our democratic and legislative process.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">    But since the organization&#8217;s leadership made the transition from representing its members to prioritizing the profits of manufacturers, they&#8217;ve lost a step.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">    In 2012, the NRA lost six of seven Senate races that it invested over $100,000 in, and 2/3 of losing House members were endorsed by the organization.</p>

When the people on the ground rose, words were written inside the outlines: “Ailene, age 6,” “boy,” “murdered,” “background check.” </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As our colleague Nicholas Confessore <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/us/politics/obamas-backers-seek-deep-pockets-to-press-agenda.html?pagewanted=all">reported,</a> President Obama&#8217;s re-election effort has been transformed into a powerful new advocacy organization to promote the president&#8217;s legislative priorities, including gun control measures and changes in immigration laws.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With 22 million Twitter followers and an e-mail list that reaches 17 million subscribers, the group&#8217;s leaders <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_mvu35FrFg">outlined their plans</a> in January and later distributed a video of Michelle Obama talking about the organization&#8217;s goals. On Friday, <a href="https://my.barackobama.com/page/s/organizing-for-action">Organizing for Action</a> held candlelight vigils and rallies around the country for what it called a &#8220;day of action&#8221;  to raise awareness for the administration&#8217;s efforts to reduce gun violence. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To help alert potential supporters, the group used Mr. Obama&#8217;s re-election e-mail list to distribute a message about the plans. Included was a request to share a video of 17-year-old Sami Rahamim, speaking about his father, who was killed at his small business in Minnesota during a mass shooting last September.  </p>

They also distributed e-mails to Obama supporters in the House members&#8217; districts, urging people to lobby their elected lawmaker. The e-mails included an easy tool for people to contact their representative on Twitter. </p>

Starbucks has resisted requests by gun control activists in the past to ban guns from its shops. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ed Levine, an executive member of the Virginia Citizens Defense League and founder of Virginia Open Carry, told the Post that the Starbucks day was aimed at showing “the general public that good guys carry guns too. Because all they hear about on the news is that someone got shot. You’ve got to quit creating gun-free zones. Schools, colleges, universities where a good guy can’t carry a gun is where the bad guys have a field day. This is just to show when you carry, you’re not only expressing your rights, but to show good guys carry.”</p>
