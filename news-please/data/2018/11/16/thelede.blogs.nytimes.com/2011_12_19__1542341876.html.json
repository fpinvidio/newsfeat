One clip, titled “How the Ghost of ’89 Appeared to Me in 2011,” showed the gathering in Prague’s Václavské Náměstí, or Wenceslas Square, the center of the 1989 Velvet Revolution led by Mr. Havel. The video showed mourners lighting candles, then walking under a giant Czech flag through Prague’s winding medieval streets.\nIn typical Czech fashion, the clip ends on a humorous note, with an excerpt from a film directed by Mr. Havel in which he emerges from below the surface of a pond, wearing a suit and tie, to say: “Thank you for turning off your cellphones. Truth and love must win over lies and hatred. You can now turn your cellphones back on.” With both arms extended in a wave, he then descends back into the pond.\nSelma Kalousek was an interpreter for the Czech delegation during Václav Havel’s first trip to the United States after the Velvet Revolution.", "url": "https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/a-farewell-to-havel-in-prague/"}
