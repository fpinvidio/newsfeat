Here is Alan Cowell’s overview of the latest developments and Graham Bowley’s report on News Corporation’s decision to stop paying the legal fees of the private investigator who hacked into phones for The News of the World, four years after he was jailed for doing so.\nAs the American Journalism Review explains, supporters of the Murdochs, or those interested in a very different perspective on the scandal, might enjoy this Wall Street Journal editorial.\nThanks for your comments.", "url": "https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/latest-updates-on-phone-hacking-scandal-2/"}
