<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Here, from ITN, is a selection of highlights from Tuesday&#8217;s parliamentary hearings into phone hacking at The News of the World.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the day&#8217;s first session, Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan Police commissioner who announced his intention to resign on Sunday, was questioned about the fact that a luxury spa, Champneys, which offered him $19,000 worth of free hospitality, employed Neil Wallis, a former tabloid editor who recently worked as a public relations consultant for Scotland Yard and was arrested last week in connection with phone hacking. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qImE7o65Yvo">this clip</a> shows, Sir Paul said that while he had no idea that Mr. Wallis worked for the spa, it was &#8220;damnably unlucky&#8221; for him that he did:</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Next are excerpts from the testimony of John Yates, who resigned on Monday as Scotland Yard&#8217;s assistant commissioner. Mr. Yates has been criticized for not properly vetting Mr. Wallis before he was offered a contract with Scotland Yard. Mr. Yates told the committee on home affaris: &#8220;I sought assurances off Mr. Wallis, before the contract was let, to the effect &#8212; I&#8217;ve got a note, I can read it for you if you like &#8212; &#8216;Is there anything that Nick Davies [of The Guardian] is still chasing, still reporting on, that could embarrass you, Mr. Wallis, me, the commissioner or the Metropolitan Police?&#8217; And I received categorical assurances.&#8221; </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the start of their joint appearance before the Commons select committee on culture, media and sport, James Murdoch and his father Rupert took time to apologize. James Murdoch apologized &#8220;to the victims of illegal voice mails interceptions and their families.&#8221; Moments later, his father then interrupted him and said: &#8220;I would just like to say one sentence: This is the most humble day of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Under questioning from Tom Watson, a Labour Party member of Parliament, Rupert Murdoch said that more than $1 million had been paid to settle a lawsuit brought by Gordon Taylor, a union official whose phone had been hacked, without his knowledge:</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Here is one more view of the intervention of an &#8220;activist/comedian&#8221; who rushed at Rupert Murdoch with a pie and was slapped in the face by Mr. Murdoch&#8217;s wife Wendi in the ensuing melee:</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">During her testimony later in the day, Rebekah Brooks, a former editor of The News of the World, said that she had never sanctioned payments to police officers for information. She said that remarks she made in 2003 to the committee &#8212; when she said, &#8220;We have paid the police for information&#8221; &#8212; referred not to the  actions of her own newspaper, but to what she knew of the British newspaper industry in general. Here is what Ms. Brooks said on Tuesday:</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The man sitting next to Ms. Brooks during that appearance in 2003 was her former deputy at The News of the World, Andy Coulson, who resigned in January as Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s media adviser and was arrested recently in connection with a new investigation into bribery.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Like James Murdoch, Ms. Brooks has returned repeatedly to the idea that News International, the British newspaper division of News Corporation, relied on legal advice from a respected firm, <a href="//www.harbottle.com/hnl/pages/hnl.php?gclid=">Harbottle &#038; Lewis</a>. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Writing <a href="https://www.twitter.com/DavidAllenGreen">on Twitter</a>, David Allen Green, a blogger and legal correspondent for The New Statesman, noted that the law firm that has reportedly asked News International to release its lawyers from their confidentiality undertakings to respond but the company has so far refused to do so.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Green also <a href="https://www.twitter.com/DavidAllenGreen/status/93378890751414272">sent a message</a> via /Twitter to a member of the parliamentary panel, Tom Watson, suggesting that the panel should &#8220;have a think about formally summoning Harbottle &#038; Lewis.&#8221; </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If they were summoned, Mr. Green wrote, it seems that the terms of parliamentary privilege mean that the firm&#8217;s lawyers could disclose the advice they gave News International executives.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On Monday, <a href="//www.legalweek.com/legal-week/news/2094792/harbottle-defends-hackgate-position-grabiner-tipped-lead-newscorp-clean">Legal Week reported</a> that Harbottle &#038; Lewis had &#8220;issued a letter in response to allegations in the press that the firm made a mistake in its part in an internal investigation into phone-hacking at News International.&#8221; Legal Week added:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">
In an open letter sent earlier today (18 July), Harbottle said that its ability to respond to the allegations made last week by News Corporation head Rupert Murdoch were constrained by factors including client confidentiality.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Harbottle&#8217;s letter states: &#8220;Despite the constraints upon us, we can make it clear that many recent press reports have not accurately described the extent of our retainer from News International in 2007. Unfortunately we are not at present able to correct these errors by explaining what the scope of that retainer was, since that is (or at least may be, depending on technical legal arguments) privileged information.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;All of these issues will no doubt become clearer in due course, especially when all of the relevant parties co-operate fully with the various investigations and inquiries. In the mean time, we will say more as and when it becomes professionally possible to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The BBC reports <a href="//www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14193124">on its live blog</a> that Neil Wallis, a former deputy editor of The News of the World who was arrested last week in connection with the new police investigation into phone hacking at the tabloid, &#8220;may have provided &#8216;informal advice&#8217; to Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s former communications chief Andy Coulson before last year&#8217;s general election, according to a new statement from the Conservative Party.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Coulson, who resigned as the editor of The News of the World after the first arrests in the hacking scandal in 2007, was hired several months later by Mr. Cameron. He was also arrested last week.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Speaking to the Commons committee, Ms. Brooks, who was the editor of The News of the World in 2002, was asked about an incident that year, when her journalists reportedly hacked into the voice mail of a missing 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler. The girl was later found murdered, but during the frantic search for her, News of the World journalists reportedly listened to her voice mails and deleted some of them to free up space so that more could be left.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Brooks insisted that she had no idea that Milly Dowler&#8217;s voice mail was intercepted until it was <a href="//www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jul/04/milly-dowler-voicemail-hacked-news-of-world">first reported by The Guardian</a> two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">According to that Guardian article, Ms. Brooks must not have been reading her own newspaper closely at the time if she was unaware that her reporters had gained access to the missing girl&#8217;s voice mail. Nick Davies and Amelia Hill reported:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">
The paper made little effort to conceal the hacking from its readers. On 14 April 2002 it published a story about a woman allegedly pretending to be Milly Dowler who had applied for a job with a recruitment agency: &#8220;It is thought the hoaxer even gave the agency Milly&#8217;s real mobile number … the agency used the number to contact Milly when a job vacancy arose and left a message on her voice mail … it was on March 27, six days after Milly went missing, that the employment agency appears to have phoned her mobile.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The newspaper also made no effort to conceal its activity from Surrey police. After it had hacked the message from the recruitment agency on Milly&#8217;s phone, the paper informed police about it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Brooks told the committee she had no idea that Milly Dowler&#8217;s voice mail had been hacked at the time and said that no one &#8220;in their right mind&#8221; would have authorized that hacking.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As Ms. Brooks continues to claim that other newspapers have used phone hacking and paid police officers to get stories, Louise Mensch, a Conservative member of Parliament, appears to have misrepresented a passage from the autobiography of Piers Morgan, a former editor of two British tabloids, The News of the World and The Mirror.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Mensch claimed that Mr. Morgan, who now works for CNN, boasted of phone hacking in his book, &#8220;<a href="//www.amazon.co.uk/Insider-Private-Diaries-Scandalous-Decade/dp/0091908493/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1">The Insider: The Private Diaries of a Scandalous Decade</a>.&#8221; A look at the book, however, shows that this is not correct. Mr. Morgan wrote that he suspected that he had been a victim of phone hacking, not that his reporters had used the practice to get information.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Morgan wrote that, at one stage, he was puzzled as to how other newspapers had obtained confidential information about him. In one entry in the dairy, he wrote: &#8220;I am mystified. But someone suggested today that people might be listening to my mobile messages. Apparently, if you don&#8217;t change the standard security code that every phone comes with, then anyone can call your number and, if you don&#8217;t answer, tap in the standard four digit code to hear your messages. I&#8217;ll change mine just in case, but it makes me wonder how many public figures and celebrities are aware of this little trick.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It might be that Ms. Mensch has not read Mr. Morgan&#8217;s book, but instead <a href="//order-order.com/2011/07/13/britains-got-hacking/">a recent post</a> on the British blog Guido Fawkes, which printed that passage out of context to support the allegation that Mr. Morgan had sanctioned phone hacking.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When Ms. Mensch made the same incorrect claim about his book during the earlier session with the Murdochs, Mr. Morgan <a href="https://www.twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/93354730243366914https://www.twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/93354730243366914">objected on Twitter</a>: &#8220;That MP just claimed I boasted in my book of using phone-hacking for a scoop.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Rupert Murdoch just steered the conversation to the importance of investigative journalism and a free press to a healthy society. He said that British society is healthier and more transparent as a result, even more so than American society.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He then brought up, as an example, the expenses scandal, which was revealed through leaked documents which were purchased by The Daily Telegraph. He added that in Singapore, legislators are paid huge sums of money and so are not reduced to corruption. In other words, he seems to have just suggested that the people asking him these questions should be given huge raises.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That seems at odds with his earlier statement that he makes frequent phone calls to the editors of those papers.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Paul Farrelly, a Labour member of Parliament, showed James Murdoch a letter submitted to the committee by the company at an earlier date, on the subject of an internal inquiry carried out by lawyers working for News International, and asked him if he would like to withdraw it. Mr. Murdoch said that he was &#8220;not aware of the legal technicalities,&#8221; of doing so, and so would not. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The discussion turns on the fact that a law firm hired by the company in 2007 <a href="//www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14099102">to review 2,500 internal e-mails</a>, concluded that the top editors at The News of the World &#8212; Andy Coulson, Neil Wallis and Ian Edmondson &#8212; were not aware of phone hacking.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As my colleagues <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/world/europe/19tactics.html">Jo Becker and Ravi Somaiya reported</a> on Monday night:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">
Colin Myler, who succeeded Mr. Coulson as editor of The News of the World, told Parliament in 2007 that News International had turned over as many as 2,500 e-mails to the law firm of Harbottle &#038; Lewis, which the company had retained in the matter. In a letter to Parliament at the time, the firm said it did not find anything in the e-mails linking hacking to three top editors — Mr. Coulson, Neil Wallis and Mr. Edmondson.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But a company official speaking on the condition of anonymity said that the 2,500 e-mails given to the law firm related only to Mr. Goodman and represented only a small portion of the company’s e-mail traffic.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To American viewers, used to seeing witnesses at Congressional hearings pause frequently to consult lawyers sitting with them, it is interesting to see that witnesses appear before Commons parliamentary committees without that sort of shield. </p>

The BBC <a href="//www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14193124">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">
Much of the questioning focused on the decision to employ a former News of the World deputy editor, Neil Wallis, to provide media support to the police. Mr. Yates agreed he was a friend but says &#8220;codswallop&#8221; has been written about how close they were.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Murdoch was asked if he got anything in return for supporting political parties in Britain by Jim Sheridan of the Scottish Labour Party.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Murdoch said that he was asked to enter through that door to avoid photographers and did what he was told.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He also said that his newspapers suffered the &#8220;direct loss&#8221; of 200,000 readers as a result of their decision to back Tony Blair&#8217;s Labour Party in 1997.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A short time later, Mr. Murdoch said that he was not responsible for the phone hacking at his British newspaper company, telling the committee that he blamed &#8220;the people I trusted to run it and the people they trusted.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Murdoch also said that he had no knowledge about the allegation that News of the World journalists attempted to hack into the phones of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Watson asked Mr. Murdoch &#8220;at what point did you discover that criminality was endemic&#8221; at News International, the British newspaper division of News Corporation.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Murdoch replied that &#8220;endemic is a very hard word.&#8221; He adds that he wants to be careful not to say anything that could compromise the criminal investigation now underway but insists that he was &#8220;absolutely shocked, appalled&#8221; to learn about the hacking of Milly Dowler&#8217;s phone. Milly was a 13-year-old girl who went missing in 2002 and was later found murdered.

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Yates told the committee that he did ask Neil Wallis, the former editor of News of the World who was later employed by Scotland Yard, if there was any possibility that reporting by Nick Davies of The Guardian would link Mr. Wallis to the phone hacking scandal. He said that Mr. Wallis assured him, in 2009, that there was no reason for concern and that he made a written note of that at the time.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He also insisted that, beyond this, he had not played a formal role in vetting Mr. Wallis and was not asked to perform &#8220;due diligence,&#8221; before Mr. Wallis was offered a contract.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He also explained that while he and Mr. Wallis are friends, they usually meet just a few times a year, to attend sporting matches in the company of a larger group. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He also said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a scintilla of concern in 2009,&#8221; about Mr. Wallis being connected in any way to the phone hacking scandal.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Yates was then asked if he had helped Mr. Wallis&#8217;s daughter to get a job at Scotland Yard. He replied, &#8220;I was a post box for a CV, from Mr. Wallis&#8217;s daughter.&#8221; He said that he had merely passed her e-mail and a CV on to the Yard&#8217;s personnel department, in January 2009, and expressed no interest in whether she got a job or not.</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sir Paul was asked by David Winnick, a Labour member of Parliament, about the fact that Neil Wallis, a former deputy editor of The News of the World, was hired as a consultant by Scotland Yard in 2009, weeks after The Guardian reported that phone hacking had been far more widespread than the initial police investigation had suggested.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Winnick suggests that it was &#8220;amazing&#8221; that a senior editor of the tabloid newspaper was hired by the police so soon after questions were raised about the limited police investigation of wrongdoing at the newspaper.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sir Paul said that he had no reason to believe that Mr. Wallis had been aware of phone hacking. He added that senior executives at News International, the British newspaper division of Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corporation, had assured him that the misconduct at The News of the World had been carried out by just one reporter, without the knowledge of editors like Mr. Wallis.</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sir Paul was pressed to explain why he had so many lunches and dinners with executives from News Corporation&#8217;s British newspaper division in recent years. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He replied that he thought it was necessary to meet with newspapers to make sure that Scotland Yard policies and investigations were properly understood. He added that he met with executives from other newspaper companies as well and it was not his fault that Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s company was allowed to own such a large share of the British newspaper business.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Andrew Sparrow, writing on <a href="//www.guardian.co.uk/media/blog/2011/jul/19/phone-hacking-rupert-murdoch-rebekah-brooks-mps">The Guardian&#8217;s live blog</a>, caught the statistics that Sir Paul offered in his won defense. The Scotland Yard chief said that 17 percent of his press contacts related to The News of the World and the paper had almost exactly that has percentage of the newspaper market. He also said that about 30 percent of his contacts were with editors or executives from the British newspaper division of News Corporation. Since, he said, that company&#8217;s newspapers made up has 42 percent of the national readership, that percentage seemed appropriate.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sir Paul was also asked about why he suggested during meetings with The Guardian&#8217;s editors that the newspaper was giving too much coverage to phone hacking. He replied that he wanted to know why the paper was not accepting police assurances that there was no need for a new investigation.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sir Paul is now facing questions about the fact that he accepted a free stay worth $19,000 at <a href="//www.champneys.com/">Champneys</a>, a luxury spa, earlier this year, where Neil Wallis, the former tabloid editor who was on contract at Scotland Yard, was a public-relations adviser.</p>

</p></div>
<div class="updated-entry-content">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The chairman of the committee, Keith Vaz, asked Sir Paul to say if he had intended to take a swipe at Prime Minister David Cameron in his statement of resignation. He replied, &#8220;I was taking no such swipe at the prime minister,&#8221; and said that his remarks, in which he compared Mr. Cameron&#8217;s employment of Andy Coulson, a former editor of The News of the World, to Scotland Yard&#8217;s hiring of a former depity editor of the same newspaper, Neil Wallis, had been misunderstood. He intended no slight, he said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On the subject of Mr. Wallis, who was hired in 2009 as a communications adviser for Scotland Yard after he left The News of the World, Sir Paul called it a &#8220;very minor and part-time&#8221; role.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sir Paul adds that the first time he had any idea that Mr. Wallis was connected to the investigation of phone hacking at The News of the World was in January of this year, when he read about it in the press.</p>
