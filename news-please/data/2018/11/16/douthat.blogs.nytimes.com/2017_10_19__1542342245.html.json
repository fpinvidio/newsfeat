One-night stands? Fine, so long as there’s consent. May/December relationships. Fantastic, so long as there’s consent. Workplace liaisons between boss and subordinate? No problem, with consent. Adultery? Yes, there are tears, but the heart wants what it wants. The practical result of consent-focused morality is the sexualization of everything. With the line drawn at desire alone, there is no longer any space that’s sex-free. Work meetings or restaurants can be creative locations for steamy liaisons. Not even marriage or existing relationships stand as a firewall against potential hookups. The problem, of course, is that people don’t walk around broadcasting their desires. We don’t have a flashing “yes” or “no” that hovers over our heads. So someone has to make the ask. Someone has to make the move. Consent is determined by the request, and in a completely sexualized culture, the request can come at any time, anywhere, and from any person you encounter — regardless of the power imbalance or the propriety of the location. And for powerful people in particular, the ask so often has fruitful results — sometimes out of genuine desire, sometimes out of fear, and sometimes out of a sense of intimidated resignation — that the ask quickly blurs into expectation, and expectations can yield demands.\nI agree with much of this, but I think it’s important for social conservatives to recognize that the predation of powerful men (and men generally) is hard for any moral system to contain. In a world of consent and assumed promiscuity, the predator plays on the idea that sex isn’t such a big deal, that what he’s asking for is really a small thing, that you should be a good sport and play along and if you’re offended or hurt or feel that you’ve been violated well look we’re all adults here and again, it’s just sex, it’s transactional and ephemeral, an exchange of pleasures so why not an exchange of pleasure for a job, and I’m sorry that my pursuit of self-fulfillment didn’t quite respect your boundaries, but since I didn’t rape you and maybe you led me on you don’t have any grounds for complaint …\n… but in a world of more stringent moral rules, a world that emphasizes sexual restraint and make chastity a virtue, the same predator might find a different way. He might be more aggressive, for instance, and then play on his victim’s sense of shame, her desire to be chaste and her feeling that she’s been soiled by the encounter, to induce her not to tell anyone and perhaps even to continue seeing him, because after once you’ve fallen there’s no point in getting up, you’re just a fallen women and you might as well accept it. And he might rely on a different kind of authority: Not the authority of the creeper boss or colleague, but the aristocratic or spiritual authority that more hierarchical societies tend to invest their leaders with — the priest/prophet/king combination that can be abused just as easily as the authority of a Hollywood producer.\nRead this grim story from a Mormon woman on Rod Dreher’s blog for a concrete example of how this works — how a virtue-ethics society can enable a predator just as much a more permissive one. It’s exactly the kind of story that liberals cite to argue for reducing sexual morality to the rule of consent: Because the alternative, they insist, is a world where predators just rely on sexual shame and institutional self-protection (see Catholicism, recent history of) to keep their depredations secret or unpunished. Only by removing any hint of shame from a consensual encounter, the theory goes, can non-consensual encounters receive the condemnation they deserve.\nI don’t think this is right, but a few related things are true. First, what we think of as traditional sexual ethics, a code of chastity before marriage and monogamy thereafter, has been historically entangled with a patriarchal sexism that male predators have used to their advantage. Which shouldn’t be surprising because all moral systems and social orders have their weak spots, their places where the power of male predation finds a way. Indeed predators are often good at a kind of code-switching, playing on both permissive and hierarchical attitudes at once, relying on the sacred and the profane, on prejudices both liberal and conservative, for justification and protection. This was often true of abusive Catholic priests in the 1970s, it was true more recently in the Rotherham grooming horror, and it seems to have been true in the depressing case of the Mennonite theologian John Howard Yoder, who relied on a mix of anti-bourgeois radicalism and very traditional spiritual authority for his weird depredations.\nAnd then further, while it’s almost certainly true (as I wrote this weekend) that the chaos associated with the first phase of the sexual revolution — call it 1963-1980 — made predation way, way worse, it’s also almost certainly true that the norms of feminism and the code of consent have imposed some effective guardrails since, especially where underage victims are concerned. Which makes it possible (though by no means certain) that these norms will become somewhat more effective every time there’s a big cascade of revelations — that there’s an iterative process where a pig’s downfall becomes a cautionary tale to would-be pigs, and a source of greater confidence for potential victims, and things really do get better.\nThis means that conservatives arguing for a different, thicker sexual ethic than just the rule of “consent” need to recognize that any revived code of sexual restraint would need to draw on the insights of feminism as well as those of pre-sexual revolution sources, lest it fall back into the sins of patriarchy once again. And it means that the depredations of Weinstein and his ilk may be suggestive evidence of our system’s flaws, but they aren’t necessarily the best evidence that it’s actively failing and should be reformed or overthrown.\nWhat’s the best evidence? In certain ways I think the mess on college campuses — not the clearly-rape cases, not the Hefnerite excesses of frat culture (which a stronger feminism might eventually restrain), but the endless gray-zone drunk-sex cases at the most self-consciously progressive schools — tells us more about the inherent problems with “consent alone” than does the mess in Hollywood, because it’s a case where there’s more social equality, less boss-on-minion pressure, and a generally sex-positive culture of experimentation … and yet young people still clearly desire and need a system of rules stronger than consent alone to protect them from feeling unexpected rage or shame over how a particular encounter happened.\nBut really the strongest evidence is rather less dramatic than the extremes of rape and assault, predation and harassment. It lies in the fact that our consenting-adults moral system isn’t serving what should be the obvious ends of any moral-sexual ecosystem: To make people happy, to make women happy, to successfully balance the often very different sexual/romantic impulses of the sexes, to pair off as many people as wish to be paired off as contentedly as possible in ways that ensure stable environments for their children to flourish, and to encourage the continuation of present societies and the human race.\nAcross all of these counts the Western sexual order just doesn’t seem to be working out very well. We are several generations into the post-sexual revolution world, and women are less happy than they were before, people are marrying less and (despite what you would expect from self-selection) the marriages that do happen are less contented than in the past, people are consistently missing their desired fertility, a huge share of children (especially the poorest and most vulnerable children) are growing up without both their biological parents, and some of the wealthiest societies in the world are headed for a demographic cliff. And then there’s the fact that the sexes are politically polarized as never before, that both smug marrieds and singletons are having less sex than in the past, the recrudescent of toxic misogyny (among woke Marxist bros as well as alt-righters, in some cases) now that the internet has removed certain social filters, and more.\nLooking out across this landscape, a renewed social conservatism isn’t the only plausible response; there’s always the more radical Marxist and feminist alternatives, which argue that the sexual revolution we did have was fatally compromised by capitalism and male privilege. But I think a second look at sexual conservatism is much more plausible than a status quo bias, in which sexual liberalism is supposed to have created a level of social happiness and personal fulfillment that is simply not in evidence from data or anecdote alike.\nBut again, this indictment of the status quo isn’t at its strongest in cases like Weinstein. The persistence of predation in progressive circles does point to certain problems with liberal consent culture, but predation is also a problem that we shall always have with us, and one that relative to the Hef-and-Polanski era the current moral order has at least partially restrained (or, in some cases, dulled with a permanent supply of porn).\nRather it’s everything else, the failure of ordinary relations between the sexes, that indicts our present order and suggests that we need a different way — either the greater radicalism and utopianism urged by the most rigorous and consistent left-feminists, or else a return to ideas about restraint that were taken for granted in the past not because people were blind or bigoted, but because they made a better fit with human nature and human flourishing than where we’ve ended up.", "url": "https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/the-age-of-consent-and-its-discontents/"}
