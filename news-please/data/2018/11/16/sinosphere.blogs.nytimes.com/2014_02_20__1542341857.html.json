In an article published in November, the top Communist Party official in Tibet signaled how China was planning to clamp down on the Dalai Lama’s ability to get his message out.\n“Strike hard against the reactionary propaganda,” Chen Quanguo, the party chief in Tibet, wrote in the party journal Qiushi. He said the government would confiscate illegal satellite dishes, heighten monitoring of online content and take other measures to prevent the dissemination of the Dalai Lama’s message in areas with Tibetan populations so that “the voice and image of the enemy forces and the Dalai clique are neither seen nor heard.”\nThe Dalai Lama was also in Washington for a meeting Thursday with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative organization. In a possible reflection of the political sensitivities of the meeting with Mr. Obama, it will not take place in the Oval Office, but rather in the White House’s map room.\nThe White House visit comes as Washington’s relations with Beijing have already been strained by territorial disputes between China and key American allies, including Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, involving competing claims in the South China Sea and East China Sea.\nIn 2009, Mr. Obama declined to meet with the Dalai Lama before a planned trip to China, a decision that was widely criticized. However, he did meet him after his return. This time, the meeting will occur before Mr. Obama’s April trip to Asia, when he will visit American allies in a trip that will bypass China.\nIn the Foreign Ministry statement, Ms. Hua accused the United States of meddling in China’s internal affairs by going ahead with the visit.\n“It must be pointed out that Tibetan affairs are purely a domestic matter of China, and no foreign country has the right to meddle,” she said. “The Dalai is a political exile who for a long time has wielded the banner of religion to engage in anti-China separatist activities.”\nChris Buckley contributed reporting.", "url": "https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/obama-to-meet-dalai-lama-at-white-house/"}
