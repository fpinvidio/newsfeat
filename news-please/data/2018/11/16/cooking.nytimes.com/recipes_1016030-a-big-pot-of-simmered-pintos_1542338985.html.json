If I know that I’m going to use these beans for a Mexican dinner I season them with cilantro and, if I can find it, epazote. If I want Italian or Provençal flavors I make a bouquet garni with bay leaf, thyme, parsley, maybe sage, and most definitely a Parmesan rind. This week, since I am using my beans as a starting off point for other dishes, I season them only with onion, garlic, bay leaf and salt. The dishes that will follow throughout the week will introduce more flavors.\nFeatured in: A Big Pot Of Simmered Pintos.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016030-a-big-pot-of-simmered-pintos"}
