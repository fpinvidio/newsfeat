A pile of cold brown rice with a few chopped vegetables and some soy sauce or a mound of wheat berries with vinaigrette is about as one-dimensional as it gets. This niçoise salad turns that problem on its head, with tuna used in a powerful vinaigrette tossed with farro.

Whichever you use, the results are nutty and sublime.\nFeatured in: The Whole Story.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014918-farro-nicoise"}
