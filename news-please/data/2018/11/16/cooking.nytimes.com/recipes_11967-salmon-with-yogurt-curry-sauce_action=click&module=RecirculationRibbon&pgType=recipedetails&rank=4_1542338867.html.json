Here I cook it with a yogurt sauce that contains just chopped cucumber and spices. If you use farmed salmon and a nonstick skillet, you won't even need to add any fat. That's because farmed salmon is so high in fat (fattier than wild salmon, and it's the beneficial omega-3 type, too) that it's difficult to overcook. This is not to say you can put it on the stove and walk away, but that precision is a goal rather than a necessity. Even if you like your fish cooked through, the result will be a piece of meat that still has a fair amount of moisture in it.\nFeatured in: The Minimalist; Salmon, Richly Spiced.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11967-salmon-with-yogurt-curry-sauce?action=click&module=RecirculationRibbon&pgType=recipedetails&rank=4"}
