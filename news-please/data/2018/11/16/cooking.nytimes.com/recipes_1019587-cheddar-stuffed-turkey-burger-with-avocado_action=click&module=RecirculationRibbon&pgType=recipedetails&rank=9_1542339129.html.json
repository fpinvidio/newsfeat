Adding fat. The burgers in this recipe, stuffed with cheese and a bit of butter, are moist, flavorful and, best of all, hold together and flip easily. These are best cooked on a flat-top griddle, burger-joint style, or you can use a large, wide skillet (like cast-iron) if thatâ€™s what you have. Both give the outside of these burgers an irresistible sear that keeps the juice and flavor inside the burger, not dripping through grill grates. Finally, Hawaiian buns are a must. Their softness and subtle sweetness give these burgers a universal appeal.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019587-cheddar-stuffed-turkey-burger-with-avocado?action=click&module=RecirculationRibbon&pgType=recipedetails&rank=9"}
