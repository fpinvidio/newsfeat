And it’s wonderful as a dipping sauce for vegetables. But its best use may be as a marinade for roast chicken. The mild chicken absorbs all the zippy flavors of the dressing, to emerge from the oven fragrant and golden, flecked with green. To intensify the herbal flavor, some of the green goddess mixture is set aside to use as a sauce. You could even pour a little on a salad or some vegetables on the side, and enjoy the best of all the Green Goddess variations in one savory bite.\nFeatured in: Chicken Offered To The Green Goddess.\nLearn: How to Roast Chicken", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015232-green-goddess-roasted-chicken"}
