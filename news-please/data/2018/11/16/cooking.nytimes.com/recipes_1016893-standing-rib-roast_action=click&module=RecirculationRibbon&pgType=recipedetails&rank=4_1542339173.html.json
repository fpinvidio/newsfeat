A little horseradish sauce might be served on the side, but her father always disapproved. Good beef doesn’t need it. “He thought sauce was for drugstore cowboys,” she said.\nFeatured in: The United States Of Thanksgiving.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016893-standing-rib-roast?action=click&module=RecirculationRibbon&pgType=recipedetails&rank=4"}
