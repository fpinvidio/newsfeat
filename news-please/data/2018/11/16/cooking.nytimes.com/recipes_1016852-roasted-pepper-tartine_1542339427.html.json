Like a piece of pizza, a tartine is constructed from a thick slice of rustic bread, lightly toasted. A savory topping and some good French cheese precede a few minutes of browning under the broiler. This tartine features garlicky roasted pepper strips (fresh or from a jar), a dab of sundried tomato purée (sliced fresh tomatoes in summer) and black olives. A thick slice of goat cheese makes a perfect pairing, or use Camembert if you prefer. Make a green salad to serve alongside for a quick light meal, or you may cut the tartine into small wedges to serve with drinks.\nFeatured in: Grilled Cheese?
