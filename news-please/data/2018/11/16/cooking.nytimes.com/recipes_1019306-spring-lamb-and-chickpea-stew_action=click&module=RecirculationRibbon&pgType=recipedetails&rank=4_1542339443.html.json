This stew is quite brothy, and full of greens, wilted in olive oil with green garlic, carrots and fava beans or peas. A healthy sprinkling of roughly chopped mint adds brightness. Itâ€™s important to use dried chickpeas, because they add flavor to the broth as they slowly cook with the lamb. And an overnight soak is essential: The soaked dried chickpeas will swell to three times their original size, which gives them the proper creamy texture when cooked.\nFeatured in: Lamb Stew, Now Lighter And Brighter.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019306-spring-lamb-and-chickpea-stew?action=click&module=RecirculationRibbon&pgType=recipedetails&rank=4"}
