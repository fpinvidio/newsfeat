It’s inspired by Ms. Singer’s favorite street food. Ceviche is almost always so astringent that the fish loses identity, but the freshness of the ingredients and softness of the lime marinade here are neither confrontational nor eye-squinching.

Making the dish takes a bit of work, but it’s the perfect recipe for when you don’t want to turn on the stove.\nFeatured in: Kitchen Voyeur; Organically Grown.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/7752-scallop-and-halibut-ceviche-salad?action=click&module=RecirculationRibbon&pgType=recipedetails&rank=1"}
