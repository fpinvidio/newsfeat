It may be slightly intimidating to consider: a giant pan of rice and protein cooked on an outdoor grill. But it is remarkably easy to pull off if you have a paella pan (available online and in most cookware stores) and a healthy amount of patience. The whole game is in the preparation, so that youâ€™re not muddling around with ingredients while the fire burns down. Read the recipe two or three times before you get started and, the first time you make the paella, make sure you have everything ready before even you light the fire. Your overall time will improve with practice. But the flavors will be sublime from the very first attempt.\nFeatured in: Fire And Rice.\nLearn: How to Grill", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016085-grilled-paella"}
