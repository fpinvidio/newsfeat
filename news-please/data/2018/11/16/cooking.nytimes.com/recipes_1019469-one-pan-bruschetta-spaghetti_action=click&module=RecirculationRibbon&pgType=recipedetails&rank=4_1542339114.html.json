You won’t need a lot of time to make this, just one big pan (use your largest and deepest) and the resolve not to eat the whole pile of noodles yourself. You'll want a slightly larger cast-iron skillet here — either a 12-inch version, or a deep 10-inch — to avoid spillage. Make sure to cover the pasta with a lid or foil so it cooks faster, and to stir from time to time. Since you’re not draining the noodles as you would in a traditional pasta dish, it’s good to know that different noodle shapes, sizes and brands may soak up liquid differently and that some tomatoes may be juicier than others. Simmer as long as needed get the sauce to a consistency that’s just right for you.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019469-one-pan-bruschetta-spaghetti?action=click&module=RecirculationRibbon&pgType=recipedetails&rank=4"}
