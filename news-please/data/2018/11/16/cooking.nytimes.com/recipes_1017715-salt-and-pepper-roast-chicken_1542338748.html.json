The method is fairly straightforward. You season the bird, then roast it at high heat until the skin is bronzed and crisp and the flesh juicy. If you have time to season the chicken ahead, you should; it makes a difference in flavor. And bear in mind, if you have the kind of oven that starts smoking at high heat, you can cook your bird at 400 degrees instead of 450, though you’ll need an extra 5 to 20 minutes to get it done.\nFeatured in: Roast Chicken, The Easy Way.\nLearn: How to Roast Chicken", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017715-salt-and-pepper-roast-chicken"}
