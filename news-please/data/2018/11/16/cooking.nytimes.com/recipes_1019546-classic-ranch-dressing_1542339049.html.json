To recreate that taste, this recipe is made with garlic powder instead of garlic, dried parsley instead of fresh, and so on. It makes enough seasoning mix for about 4 cups dressing; you can mix it, store it, then add dairy as needed. If you don’t like the zip of mustard, try hot sauce or Worcestershire sauce instead — or simply omit for a milder taste. To make a thick dip instead of a pourable dressing, reduce the amount of buttermilk to 1/4 cup.\nFeatured in: Ranch Nation.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019546-classic-ranch-dressing"}
