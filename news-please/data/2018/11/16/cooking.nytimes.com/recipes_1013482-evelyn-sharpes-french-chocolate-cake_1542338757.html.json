This recipe from 1969 was one of the first published, long before the cake became fashionable. Today it may be a cliché, but it’s a swanky one. This cake is dense, but not the solid block of sweet that can make you wonder if you’re just eating chocolate ganache in cake form. Of course, since the recipe has so few ingredients, it is imperative to use truly delicious chocolate. The proportion of cacao, in case you’re wondering, should fall between 60 and 70 percent.\nFeatured in: Evelyn Sharpe’s French Chocolate Cake.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013482-evelyn-sharpes-french-chocolate-cake"}
