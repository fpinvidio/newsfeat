The dish is served in a lacquered octagonal container resembling a wooden candy box with a lid. When the lid is lifted, there is a center section in which small, round, thin pancakes are stacked. Around the center are eight receptacles that hold various savory, finely shredded foods to be added to each pancake before folding, dipping into a mustard-soy sauce and eating. The fillings can vary from table to table but normally include such things as shredded beef, mushrooms, carrots and cucumbers.\nFeatured in: Korean Dishes That Haunt The Memory.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/5950-koo-chul-paan"}
