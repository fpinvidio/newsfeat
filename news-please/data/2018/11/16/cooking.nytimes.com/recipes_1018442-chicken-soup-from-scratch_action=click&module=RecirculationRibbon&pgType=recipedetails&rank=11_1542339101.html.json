This soup has all the classic flavors (celery, carrot, parsley) but has been updated for today's cooks, who can't easily buy the stewing hen and packet of soup vegetables that old-fashioned recipes used to call for. A whole bird provides the right combination of fat, salt and flavor. Don't be tempted to use all white meat, as the flavor won't be as round. Because making soup involves the bones and deep tissues of the bird, it is particularly reassuring here to use the highest-quality poultry you can find. This method produces a fragrant, golden, savory soup you want to eat all winter long; it's a perfect backdrop for noodles, rice or matzo balls.\nFeatured in: A Superior Chicken Soup.\nLearn: How to Make Soup", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018442-chicken-soup-from-scratch?action=click&module=RecirculationRibbon&pgType=recipedetails&rank=11"}
