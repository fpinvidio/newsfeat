It's not meant for salads, but for summer drinks like shrubs. You may halve or quarter the recipe.\nUse any kind of vinegar you like, and feel free to switch up the berries. If cloudberries are all you have, so be it. You’re also supposed to macerate the berries and vinegar for three days. If you do it for just a day, it will still taste delicious.\nFeatured in: Raspberry Vinegar: 1900.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017634-raspberry-vinegar"}
