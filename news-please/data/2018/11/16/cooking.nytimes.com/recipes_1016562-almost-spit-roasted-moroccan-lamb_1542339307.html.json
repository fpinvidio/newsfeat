Paula Wolfert, the great American authority on Moroccan food, gives this slow-roasting method for achieving similar delicious results in a home oven. Ask your butcher for front quarter of lamb (also called a half bone-on chuck). It is comprised of the neck, shoulder, front shank, and some ribs, all in one piece. Alternatively, ask for 2 large bone-in shoulder roasts. The lamb emerges succulent and fragrant, thanks to careful basting with butter and spices. Serve it with warm chick peas, cumin-flavored salt and a dab of spicy harissa.\nFeatured in: Lamb, Slow Roasted The Moroccan Way, Without The Barbecue Spit.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016562-almost-spit-roasted-moroccan-lamb"}
