At ballgames, carnivals or bowling alleys you can expect a pile of limp tortilla chips, drowned in warm yellow cheese product. But nachos should, and can, be better than this.\nTry them showered in good shredded cheese and accompanied by a fragrant meat sauce, the fire of jalapeños, the chill and silkiness of sour cream, the tart excellence of a good tomato, with shredded lettuce and thin-sliced radishes. Here is avocado; there, the awesome funk of chopped cilantro.\nWant some bacon on there as well, or a slash of hot sauce? Go to! Some will add beans. Others black olives, chopped raw onion. Please do.\nBut take care to layer well. Layering is the key to loaded nacho perfection.\nFeatured in: Super Bowl 50 Playbook Calls For Loaded Nachos.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017955-loaded-nachos"}
