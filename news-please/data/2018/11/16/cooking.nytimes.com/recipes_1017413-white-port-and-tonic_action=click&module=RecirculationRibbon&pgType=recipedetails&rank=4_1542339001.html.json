The light-bodied and fruity wine pairs well with the bitterness of tonic, creating a happy, easygoing drink. A 1-to-2 ratio works best here; you don’t want to use too much tonic or the gentle flavors of the port will be overwhelmed. Choice of tonic is a matter of preference. Canada Dry makes for a livelier mix, but the lighter Q Tonic leads to a more elegant drink. La Taberna in Napa, Calif., tops the drink with a lime wedge, but I find a lemon a more harmonious companion.\nFeatured in: Beyond Gin And Tonic.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017413-white-port-and-tonic?action=click&module=RecirculationRibbon&pgType=recipedetails&rank=4"}
