But there is a way to up the ante: serve a dish so unusual that they don’t think they could make it themselves. This ice cream, from Mads Refslund of Acme restaurant in New York, a leading chef in the New Nordic movement, is one of those dishes. The inclusion of toasted oak will raise eyebrows, but requires little additional work and yields wonderful results. The preparation of the custard may require a few steps, but is actually quite simple, and the ice cream machine does most of the heavy lifting. If you have time, you can let the oak infuse for longer; the oak flavor will deepen without becoming overwhelming.\nFeatured in: A Nordic Quest In New York.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016055-oak-ice-cream"}
