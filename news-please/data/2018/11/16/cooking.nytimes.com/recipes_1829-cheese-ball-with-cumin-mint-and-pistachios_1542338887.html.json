Nut-crusted and filled with mysterious cheeses and bits of vegetable, cheese balls tend to be associated with shag rugs and tinsel, symbols of the middle-class middlebrow.

The cream cheese is mashed with goat cheese, then seasoned with cumin, coriander, lemon zest, celery hearts, mint and grated Pecorino Romano cheese. The ball is rolled in ground pistachios. For a Spanish-inspired version, try incorporating grated Manchego into the cream cheese, along with pimenton (Spanish red pepper), olives, scallion and Worcestershire sauce, then rolling it in ground almonds and smoked paprika.\nFeatured in: If You Want It Delicious, Make It Yourself.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1829-cheese-ball-with-cumin-mint-and-pistachios"}
