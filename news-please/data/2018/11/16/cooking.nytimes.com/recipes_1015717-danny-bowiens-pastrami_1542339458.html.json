And yet, like many families, Thanksgiving around my house included the traditional turkey and ham, which got a little boring. Pastrami brings something different to the table.

Serve it with plenty of hot mustard.\nFeatured in: A Chef Regains His Focus.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015717-danny-bowiens-pastrami"}
