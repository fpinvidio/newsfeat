Mr. Claiborne, it turns out, hadn’t.\n“My dictionary informs me that monkey bread is the gourdlike fruit of the baobab tree,” he wrote.\nA couple of weeks (and “numerous” letters and phone calls) later, he corrected himself, running this recipe from James Beard’s 1973 book “Beard on Bread.” We've retested the recipe, and made a couple of updates. It’s still a little different from many of the pull-apart breads you may find online, and a showstopper. Its crispy, buttery edges are almost like sweeter dinner rolls, giving way to caramelized, gooey bits at the bottom. It makes a ton, so save it for guests — or freeze the leftovers for your next French toast casserole.\nFeatured in: Q&A.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6832-monkey-bread"}
