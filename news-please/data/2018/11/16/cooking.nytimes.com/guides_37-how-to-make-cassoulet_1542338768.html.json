As the stew migrated to the Languedoc region, the fava beans were replaced by white beans, which were brought over from the Americas in the 16th century.\nAlthough there are as many cassoulets as there are kitchens in the Languedoc, three major towns of the region — Castelnaudary, Carcassonne and Toulouse — all vigorously lay claim to having created what they consider to be the only true cassoulet. It is a feud that has been going on at least since the middle of the 19th century, and probably even longer.\nIn 1938, the chef Prosper Montagné, a native of Carcassonne and an author of the first version of “Larousse Gastronomique,” attempted to resolve the dispute. He approached the subject with religious zeal, calling cassoulet “the god of Occidental cuisine” and likening the three competing versions to the Holy Trinity. The cassoulet from Castelnaudary, which is considered the oldest, is the Father in Montagné’s trinity, and is made from a combination of beans, duck confit and pork (sausages, skin, knuckles, salt pork and roasted meat). The Carcassonne style is the Son, with mutton and the occasional partridge stirred in. And the version from Toulouse, the Holy Spirit, was the first to add goose confit to the pot.\nThe recipe for cassoulet was codified by the “États Généraux de la Gastronomie” in 1966, and it was done in a way that allowed all three towns to keep their claims of authenticity. The organization mandated that to be called cassoulet, a stew must consist of at least 30 percent pork, mutton or preserved duck or goose (or a combination of the three elements), and 70 percent white beans and stock, fresh pork rinds, herbs and flavorings.\nThat settled the question of which meats to use. But there are two other main points of contention that still inspire debate: the use of tomatoes and other vegetables with the beans, and a topping of bread crumbs that crisp in the oven. Julia Child chose to do both, as we do here. “The Escoffier Cookbook” and “Larousse Gastronomique” give some recipes that include the tomatoes, vegetables and bread crumbs, and some that omit them. The beauty of it is that if you make your own cassoulet, you get to decide.\nAbove, “The Kitchen Table” by Jean-Siméon Chardin (1699-1779).", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/37-how-to-make-cassoulet"}
