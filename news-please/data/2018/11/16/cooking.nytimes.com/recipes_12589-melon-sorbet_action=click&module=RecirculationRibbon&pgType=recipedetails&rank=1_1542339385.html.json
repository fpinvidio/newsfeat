He taught me to use a small amount of corn syrup – about 5 percent of the weight of the fruit – to prevent the sorbet from developing ice crystals. A very small amount of honey will also work. I asked him what the least sugar I could get away with is, and he said it depends on the fruit, but as a general rule he uses 15 to 20 percent sugar. I decided to factor the corn syrup and honey into that weight, and my sorbets were beautiful, with great texture. You can use yellow or green melon for this as long as it’s really ripe and sweet.\nFeatured in: Fruit By The Frozen Spoonful.\nLearn: How to Make Ice Cream", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12589-melon-sorbet?action=click&module=RecirculationRibbon&pgType=recipedetails&rank=1"}
