Carefully remove the pulp from the oranges, leaving the pith and skin intact. Drain the pulp through a sieve over a bowl and press the pulp gently to extract all the juice. Reserve one cup of the juice for the ice cream and the remainder for another use. Put the orange shells and tops in a plastic bag and freeze. When the ice cream is made, spoon it into the shells, cap and freeze until ready to serve. To make lemon ice cream, follow the above recipe, substituting a half-cup of lemon juice for the one cup of orange juice.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/3457-orange-ice-cream?action=click&module=RecirculationRibbon&pgType=recipedetails&rank=4"}
