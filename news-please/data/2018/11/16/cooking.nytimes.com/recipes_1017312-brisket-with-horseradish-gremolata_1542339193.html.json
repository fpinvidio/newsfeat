Make the meat a few days ahead, it only gets better as it rests. But to get the most out of the gremolata, don’t grate the horseradish until an hour or two before serving. If you can’t find fresh horseradish, use 4 cloves minced garlic instead.\nFeatured in: Gremolata Gives Passover Brisket A Brighter Side.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017312-brisket-with-horseradish-gremolata"}
