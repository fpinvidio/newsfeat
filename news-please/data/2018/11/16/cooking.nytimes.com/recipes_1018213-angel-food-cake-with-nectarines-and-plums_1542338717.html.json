If the meringue is too stiff, the cake will not maintain its height once baked. You should be able to pour the batter into the pan. Make sure that the egg whites are at room temperature before you begin. Use an ungreased 10-inch tube pan, preferably one with a removable bottom (even better if it has feet, for air circulation when you cool it upside down). Once baked, let it cool completely in the reversed pan.\nFeatured in: Angel Food Cake, An Airy Bed For Summer Fruit.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018213-angel-food-cake-with-nectarines-and-plums"}
