At that point it is covered and cooked until tender.\nWhen I tried the “cold start” approach, substituting a low heating of the lamb with aromatics and a little butter for the usual hard sear in olive oil, it worked like (well, kind of like) magic. The overall flavor of the dish was less robust than one that began with browning, but it was equally flavorful, in a gentler way.\nFeatured in: Deep Flavor, No Browning Required.\nLearn: How to Make Tagine", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013536-tagine-style-lamb-stew?action=click&module=RecirculationRibbon&pgType=recipedetails&rank=4"}
