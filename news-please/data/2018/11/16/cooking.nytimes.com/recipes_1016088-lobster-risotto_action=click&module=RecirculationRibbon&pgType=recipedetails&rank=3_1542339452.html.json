You sautéed the empty shells in oil and cooked them off in a lot of water with an onion, a couple bay leaves and a few peppercorns, and made stock. This is as it should be, always. Lobster is expensive. Make its flavors last. And when you are ready, make this risotto. Heat the stock in a pot. Melt butter in a heavy saucepan next to it, add onions and cook them translucent, salt the whole and add Arborio rice, then stir to combine. Now start adding hot broth to the rice, a cup at a time, stirring endlessly all the while, never adding more stock until everything you have added has been absorbed. When everything is tender and creamy, add Parmesan and any leftover lobster meat you happen to have. If the answer is none, do not worry in the least. This is a rich risotto without meat, luxury eating on the cheap.\nFeatured in: Three Ways Till Sunday.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016088-lobster-risotto?action=click&module=RecirculationRibbon&pgType=recipedetails&rank=3"}
