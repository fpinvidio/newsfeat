Start them soaking the night before, then pop them in the oven in the morning for one of the most decadent brunches imaginable. Even better, you can bake a pan of bacon at the same time.

But skip the maple syrup, which would be overkill.\nFeatured in: Girl Scout French Toast: As Good As The Cookies.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017082-creme-brulee-french-toast"}
