The tender loaf is gently spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger and dotted throughout with dairy-free chocolate chips. Bonus: It's versatile. You can make it in a Bundt pan, a 10-inch loaf pan or in a muffin tin (it makes about 18 muffins). To quote one happy reader: \"Delicious! Like my platonic ideal of chocolate-chip banana bread.\" High praise, indeed.\nFeatured in: Wellâ€™s Vegetarian Thanksgiving 2012.", "url": "https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015704-vegan-chocolate-chip-banana-cake"}
