For technical reasons, however, each day’s collection has to exist as a “page” behind the scenes rather than as part of the regular daily flow of blog “posts,” like this one.\nSo, to make each day in history a bigger part of the blog, and to help students see how events in the past still resonate today, we’re creating a new daily post that explores a famous event and connects it to something in the news now.\nWe begin today with Muhammad Ali’s 1967 conviction for violating the United States Selective Service laws by refusing to be drafted.\nTo help us with this project, we’ve enlisted the staff members of Finding Dulcinea, the “Librarian of the Internet.” Their mission is to help students, educators and other Internet users learn how to find authoritative and comprehensive information online.\nBecause Finding Dulcinea has its own popular “On This Day” feature that covers a broad array of intriguing historical events with links to the best online resources to explore those events, we believed that their content complemented Times coverage well.\nStarting on June 20, staff members from Finding Dulcinea will write a short daily account of what led up each historical event, what happened that day, and what has happened since. They will then provide a brief “Connect to Today” section that looks at parallels of some kind in current news.\nLet us know what you think! As always, your comments help us shape what we do.\nDulcinea Media publishes Finding Dulcinea and maintains SweetSearch, a search engine for students.", "url": "https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/announcing-historical-headlines/"}
