<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Activities / Procedures:</strong><br />1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: As students enter the room, pass out unlabeled copies of the first page of Jack Kerouac&#8217;s &#8220;On the Road&#8221; (found online at <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/arts/15kerouac.html"> //www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/arts/15kerouac.html</a>). Allow time for students to carefully read the passage. Ask students to underline phrases they find interesting, funny, confusing or meaningful in some way. Once everyone has finished reading, allow time for all students to share one phrase they underlined to create an impromptu class poem based on Mr. Kerouac&#8217;s text. What words, ideas, images were mentioned? How did the class poem compare to the style of the actual text? As a class, discuss the following questions (written on the board prior to class):<br />  -Have you seen this type of writing before and if so, where?<br />  -Have you done this type of writing before and if so, what is it called? If not, when do you think it is commonly used?<br />  -What do you like about it? Give an example.<br />  -What do you dislike about it? Give an example.<br />
  If students didn&#8217;t mention freewriting, point out that this writing may seem similar to the uncensored type of prewriting students often do to brainstorm ideas or write rough drafts. What similarities do you see between freewriting and this excerpt?<br />
  Tell students this passage is from Jack Kerouac&#8217;s classic novel, &#8220;On the Road.&#8221; Explain that this book was a best-seller in 1957, and is still very popular today as it is representative of the Beat generation, which, according to The Beat Page (<a href="//www.rooknet.com/beatpage/index.html"> //www.rooknet.com/beatpage/index.html</a>), &#8220;began in the early 1950&#8217;s with a small and tightly connected group of young writers who demonstrated a care-free, often reckless and unquestionably fresh approach to literature as well as a demonstrative social stance toward what was sometimes referred to as &#8216;The Establishment.&#8217; The term &#8216;Beat&#8217; was reportedly coined by Jack Kerouac in the late 1940&#8217;s, but became more common at about the time that writers like himselfwere beginning to get noticed. It was quickly becoming a slang term in America after World War II, meaning &#8216;exhausted&#8217; or &#8216;beat down&#8217; and provided this generation with a definitive label for their personal and social positions and perspectives.&#8221;<br />
  Briefly discuss how the free-form style of Kerouac&#8217;s writing reflects the beliefs he shared with others from the Beat movement.<br />
  2. As a class, read and discuss the article, &#8220;Still Vital, &#8216;On the Road&#8217; Turns 50&#8243; (<a href="//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070817friday.html">//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070817friday.html</a>), focusing on the following questions:<br />  a. How do the novels &#8220;Peyton Place&#8221; and &#8220;On the Road&#8221; differ, according to the article?<br />  b. What is the basic storyline of &#8220;On the Road&#8221;?<br />  c. Based on the description of the storyline given in the article, what themes, lessons, etc. do you think this novel provides its readers?<br />  d. On what was the first version of &#8220;On the Road&#8221; written? Why do you think Mr. Kerouac did this?<br />  e. What is ironic about Mr. Kerouac being featured in Gap ads in the 1990s, based on the information in the article?<br />  f. Why is &#8220;On the Road&#8221; popular today?<br />  g. What is notable about &#8220;On the Road,&#8221; according to Robert Contant?<br />  h. How do various people interviewed for this article explain the popularity of &#8220;On the Road&#8221;?<br />  i. How does Kafe Kerouac reflect the Beat movement?<br />  j. What does Bill Savage mean when he says, &#8220;There are so many ways in which you&#8217;re not where you are and Kerouac is about being where you are&#8221;? Explain in your own words.<br />  k. Why does Ann Douglas believe students in her course do the best writing of their careers?<br />  l. Can you think of a contemporary book that has similar staying power to &#8220;On the Road&#8221;? Explain your answer.<br />
  3. Play the audio file of the first chapter of &#8220;On the Road,&#8221; found online at <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/INLINE_PLAYER/inlinePlayerScale.swf?mp3=http%3A//knews.em.nytimes.com/audiosrc/arts/Jack.mp3">https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/INLINE_PLAYER/inlinePlayerScale.swf?mp3=http%3A//knews.em.nytimes.com/audiosrc/arts/Jack.mp3. (An additional launch is available at the bottom of the article that provides an interesting graphic). Have students follow along for part of the audio file using the text from the Do-Now assignment. After the class has listened to the text, discuss the following questions:<br />   -Now that you have listened to this writing style, has your opinion of it changed? Why or why not?<br />  -What adjectives would you use to describe this type of writing?<br />  -How does this type of writing compare to the way you write for your classes?<br />  -When, if at all, have you used this type of writing?<br />
  Explain to students that &#8220;On the Road&#8221; is an example of stream-of-consciousness writing. According to The Literary Encyclopedia online <a href="//www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=1062">//www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=1062</a>, &#8220;Stream of consciousness writing aims to provide a textual equivalent to the stream of a fictional character&#8217;s consciousness. It creates the impression that the reader is eavesdropping on the flow of conscious experience in the character&#8217;s mind, gaining intimate access to their private &#8220;thoughts.&#8221; It involves presenting in the form of written text something that is neither entirely verbal nor textual. Stream-of-consciousness writing was developed in the early decades of the twentieth century when writers became interested in finding ways of laying open for readers&#8217; inspection, in a way impossible in real life, the imagined inner lives of their fictional characters. The challenge was to find ways of writing that would create plausible textual presentations of the imagined thought-streams.<br />
  Stream-of-consciousness writing comes in a variety of stylistic forms, most importantly narrated stream of consciousness and quoted stream of consciousness (&#8216;interior monologue&#8217;). Narrated stream-of-consciousness is most often composed of a variety of sentence types including psycho-narration (the narrative report of characters&#8217; psychological states) and free indirect style. Interior monologue is the direct quotation of characters&#8217; silent speech, though not necessarily marked with speech marks. &#8216;Interior monologue&#8217; is sometimes mistakenly used as a synonym for stream of consciousness writing as such.&#8221; (This definition may be copied into a handout and distributed to students to use as a reference while writing their own stream of consciousness pieces.)<br />
     Invite students to write their own stream-of-consciousness texts of about 200 words, using one of the following prompts (or another prompt, approved by the teacher):<br />   -&#8220;If I could do it all again&#8221;<br />  -&#8220;I&#8217;ve never believed&#8221;<br />  -&#8220;I wish there were more&#8221;<br />  -&#8220;My biggest worry&#8221;<br />  -&#8220;I&#8217;m most proud of&#8221;<br />
  At the end of class, students share their work in an informal setting, similar to the coffee houses that were popular among the Beat crowd.<br />
  4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students investigate the work of a Beat writer, such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg or Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and learn about his life and work. They then create a brief presentation about the author, including a reading of his work in either a short poem or excerpt from a poem, novel or memoir. The presentation should also incorporate an explanation of what students like or dislike about the piece, and what they think this work illustrates about the time in which it was written. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Further Questions for Discussion:</strong><br />-What determines whether writing is &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221;?<br />  -What can a novice writer learn from stream-of-consciousness writing?<br />  -What factors do writers consider when choosing their writing style for a particular piece of work?<br />  -What factors do you consider when writing a particular piece of work?<br />  -What words, techniques, etc. characterize your daily writing style?<br />  -How has email and text messaging changed the way you write?  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Evaluation / Assessment:</strong><br />Students will be evaluated based on participation in class activities and discussions, thoughtful completion of stream-of-consciousness pieces, and carefully planned presentations on a Beat author.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Vocabulary:</strong><br />precursor, clarion, homage, aficionados, untethered, gospel, resonates, exuberance  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Extension Activities:</strong><br />1. Write an essay exploring the types of lessons you might learn on a road trip across America with a friend. For inspiration, read the first chapter of &#8220;On the Road,&#8221; found online at <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/arts/15kerouac.html"> //www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/arts/15kerouac.html</a>).<br />
  2. Research and compile a popular culture guide of songs, movies, books, theatrical performances, paintings, sculptures, etc. that are based on or inspired by &#8220;On the Road.&#8221; For each item you include, write a brief explanation of how this work relates to Jack Kerouac&#8217;s classic text.<br />
  3. Develop a list of books that you think every bookstore should carry. Visit your local bookstore to see if these books are in stock, and if so, how many. For the books that are not in the store, write a letter persuading the owner to include your choices in his or her collection.<br />
  4. Read &#8220;On the Road&#8221; and write a book review for today&#8217;s audience, explaining its relevance (or lack of relevance) to you and your peers.<br />
  5. Choose a favorite author and write a short piece in the same style as this writer. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Interdisciplinary Connections:</strong><br />American History &#8211; Create a poster highlighting the current events, politics, popular culture (including music, movies, and books), etc. of 1957, the year &#8220;On the Road&#8221; became a best-selling novel.<br />
