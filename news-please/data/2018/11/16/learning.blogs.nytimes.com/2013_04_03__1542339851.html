<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><span id="more-129102"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In an article in this week&#8217;s Science Times, <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/science/dragonflies-natures-deadly-drone-but-prettier.html">&#8220;Nature’s Drone, Pretty and Deadly,&#8221;</a> Natalie Angier writes about something we&#8217;ve all seen, but probably misunderstood:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">African lions roar and strut and act the apex carnivore, but they’re lucky to catch 25 percent of the prey they pursue. Great white sharks have 300 slashing teeth and that ominous soundtrack, and still nearly half their hunts fail.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Dragonflies, by contrast, look dainty, glittery and fun, like a bubble bath or costume jewelry, and they’re often grouped with butterflies and ladybugs on the very short list of Insects People Like. Yet they are also voracious aerial predators, and new research suggests they may well be the most brutally effective hunters in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When setting off to feed on other flying insects, dragonflies manage to snatch their targets in midair more than 95 percent of the time, often wolfishly consuming the fresh meat on the spur without bothering to alight. “They’ll tear up the prey and mash it into a glob, munch, munch, munch,” said Michael L. May, an emeritus professor of entomology at Rutgers. “It almost looks like a wad of snuff in the mouth before they swallow it.”</p></blockquote>

<li>What was the first thing that came to your mind when you read the question, &#8220;What&#8217;s the coolest thing you&#8217;ve ever seen in nature?&#8221;</li>
<li>After you clicked on some of the photographs and read the excerpt from Ms. Angier&#8217;s article on dragonflies, did you think of other things — perhaps some aspect of nature that, like the dragonfly, you didn&#8217;t initially realize was as interesting as it is?</li>

			<p>The first thing that came to my mind was, I hope it be really cool. I wasn&#8217;t really thinking about what it could be before I watched, because I don&#8217;t like nature at all. I really didn&#8217;t think it was interesting, I&#8217;m not a fan of animals. It actually makes my flesh crawl, but on the other hand I thought this article was pretty cool. I&#8217;ve never seen anything extreme in nature dealing with animals. I&#8217;m actually scared of ALL creatures, I wont look if it looks nasty. In general, I DON&#8217;T pay attention to the natural world because I honestly hate nature. I will be freaked out by animals and insects. I cant stand nasty things flying and crawling around me.</p>

			<p>The greatest thing that I&#8217;ve seen in nature would be: The ignorance that humans have and will continue to have for the rest of their natural lives. No I&#8217;m not a pessimist, simply a truthful realist. This isn&#8217;t to be rude or mean, but really. For anyone that reads this comment and doesn&#8217;t immediately blow it off, go sit somewhere, like at lunch at school or in a public place, and listen to the conversation of people. Truly listen. You&#8217;ll see what I mean. I&#8217;m 15 myself, and no I&#8217;m not wise and I only have a slightly higher IQ than average, but I sure as heck do consider myself more mature and more intelligent than most teenagers in this terrible generation.</p>

			<p>The first thing that came to my mind when I read the question was a big water fall. Once I read the article, I had a picture of different animals hunting in my head. Its really interesting some animals make it look so easy to hunt when they only catch a small amount o their pray.<br />
  The most beautiful scene that I&#8217;ve seen in nature was in Yosemite National Park In California. I loved the waterfalls, the glaciers, and the magnificent view. I don&#8217;t really pay attention to nature that much. Im not that intrigued with the outside world. But now that spring is coming, I will be more interested with nature due to the change in season.</p>

			<p>The first thing that came to mind when I was asked the question, &#8220;what&#8217;s the coolest thing you&#8217;ve ever seen in nature?&#8221; was a crocodile because when I was younger I used to be fascinated with the reptiles dinosaur like appearance and it&#8217;s death roll.  The most interesting natural vista i&#8217;ve seen is a group of color changing jellyfish located  in an aquarium I once visited in Singapore. To me the way they changed colors and moved in such a flowing  motion amazed me. I also saw a hammerhead shark in the same aquarium and was astounded by it&#8217;s hugeness. In Ms. Angier&#8217;s article it stated that lions only catch 25% of their prey which made me wonder how successful a predator the hammerhead really is?I don&#8217;t currently pay much attention to the natural world and as a result the natural world has not affected me very much recently. However when I was younger I aspired to become a wildlife specialist like Steve Erwin. this dream led me to be more observant and caring for the natural world. I was even vegetarian for a year. I still observe and care for much of the natural world today. Ms. Angier&#8217;s article said that the dragonfly were fierce predators and many people tend to overlook them as they are small and beautiful. I believe if we observed our environment a bit more we can see many more animals that we tend to brand and overlook. I, for example, used to consider the human eye a tool we use to see our surroundings. But recently I started to find it very interesting as there are a number of functions that have to occur in the eye before we can see. We don&#8217;t even have to look around us to see some of natures most complex and magnificent features, we can even look  at ourselves more carefully and discover things that astonishes us.</p>

			<p>When reading this question, the first thing that came to my mind was The Foz do Iguaçu Waterfalls. It was the most increduble experience that I ever had in a nature place. Seeing it, I can&#8217;t say that non-nature things might be so beautiful at all. That place arised a many times ago. It was not created by human. That is the why it is so amazing. It was made by itself! That place changed my life in terms of my own looking at the world. Now, I appreciate much more nature things as well as I care about and preserve the nature as I have never done before. If everybody had a perception as well as I had the nature would not probably be so in dangerous as it is from now on.</p>

			<p>In my head i think about advancements has amazing. Referring to the question what is the most amazing thing you have ever seen. I would have to say that Incas method of stone cutting is the most amazing thing i have ever seen. I haven&#8217;t actually seen the process, but the idea is fascinating. Back then around 1460 AD they didn&#8217;t have electric blades to first, get the rock, and then shape into such away that even a knife blade cant go through the cracks of the stone blocks. The coolest thing i have ever seen in nature would have to be Batu caves, Batu cave is a giant cave where a Hindu temple was built. Now it is a tourist attraction in Malaysia, but it is still amazing. The man made features apart the cave on top of a mountain amazes me to how it formed. I know how mountains form but with a cave at the top, it almost looks like a hollowed out volcano with a circular entrance at the top of the cave. All in all that would have to be the coolest thing i have ever seen in nature.</p>

			<p>Many thoughts flooded my mind as I read the question, &#8220;what is the coolest thing you&#8217;ve ever seen in nature&#8221; because I have seen many things in nature that are fascinating and beautiful. After reading the article, it made me realize that there are many aspects to nature, such as animals and plants, that are very interesting, yet very few people seek to explore these creatures. I never would have thought that dragonflies were precise and deadly hunters because I always saw them as beautiful, gentle bugs that flew around ponds and water.<br />
    Every day I notice beauty in nature and sometimes I may stop to observe the deer in my backyard, or stick my face up to a ladybug perched on my window. And then of course there are the more extraordinary cases where I am truly astonished. For example I love seeing the tropical fish in aquariums and observing the exotic animals in zoos. I also love looking at the sky and just outside because sometimes the sky will look very scary, and sometimes it shows a beautiful sunset or rainbow. Another time I love observing nature is when I am at the beach. From digging through the sand to find a crab to watching the seagulls chase after another, the beach is a wonderful place to enjoy nature.<br />
   In general, I would say I pay a lot of attention to the natural world. A lot of the time, I will find myself with a camera outside, taking pictures of things that fascinate me or that I find very beautiful. I deeply appreciate the beauty of nature, and I think others should do the same.</p>

			<p>Once about 20 years ago, there was a partial solar eclipse in Los Angeles.<br />
Outside my office was a tree with lots of leaves waving in a slight brief.<br />
The holes between the leaves acted like constantly changing pinhole cameras.<br />
There was an ever-changing pattern on the ground, maybe 50 to 100 at any given time, made up of individual pinhole images of the eclipse.<br />
Stunningly beautiful.</p>

			<p>Recently, the coolest thing, is watching Great Blue Herons rebuild their nests, watching them in flight, observing them capture fish and photographing these moments.  They are amazing, graceful, and at times, humorous to observe.  A splendid and beautiful bird, worthy of their name, The Great Blue Heron.</p>
<p>Being an amateur photographer, I make a habit of seeing the world differently, taking time to evaluate situations and am particularly drawn to wildlife.</p>

			<p>One time I saw a red-tailed hawk in my back yard and it was eating a small bird. That was really cool. After it was done I went outside and looked at it, but all that was left was some blood, a lot of feathers, and it&#8217;s beak. <img src="//learning-admin.em.nytimes.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

			<p>A clown fish living in a sea anemonea is an amazing sight in nature.  How the clown fish survives when other life is stung by the sea anemonea and dies is a wonder to me.  That can&#8217;t be inherited.  So many aspects of nature are cool, I love it!</p>

			<p>The coolest that i have seen in nature would have to be a baby bird flying out of the nest for the first time. I was camping out with the scout troop from my church, i was walking with a few of the boys that is when we heard something strange. When we went to go see what it was, we saw a baby bird trying to fly out of the nest for the first time. At first was having trouble but in the end it flew out of it&#8217;s nest with it&#8217;s mom.</p>

			<p>The coolest thing I have seen was a snake on my window. It did freak me out but that was okay. The snake was red, white, and yellow. The colors were just so beautiful. It wasn&#8217;t moving much. But, we had to grab the snake and take him out. That was one beautiful snake I have seen since I moved to my house.</p>

			<p>There are many cool things in life that you will be able to see but, there&#8217;s one thing that you notice that you will remember for the rest of your days. The coolest thing I&#8217;ve seen in a 3500 pound truck driving through  a big mud hole and trying to make it to the other side. The roaring engine that will  vibrate your chest  and, the mud flying through the air getting all the people watching covered in mud . That is the coolest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>

			<p>The coolest thing in nature I&#8217;ve seen was the Venus flytrap from a field trip I took in 5th grade.  I never knew that the flytrap ate insects by trapping them in with their leaves.  I seen them last year at Moore&#8217;s creak national battlefield while we were touring the area . These plants are so interesting to me that I&#8217;ve taken Science more seriously than I ever have and I enjoyed learning about the flytrap.</p>

			<p>The coolest thing I&#8217;ve seen in nature is a big turkey fly down and beat the crap out of a decoy one hunting morning. The decoy coming apart and the turkey felt like he won and I gave him a tattoo of lead shot on his face.</p>

			<p>The coolest thing I have seen in nature was sitting in a tree stand with my dad last deer season and watching this 8 point come from about 200 yards away up to 80 yards away(the kill spot.) When we first saw him he was like I said about 200 yards away, standing on his hind legs for short amounts of time trying to get berries from a tree. When he stopped he started heading to our sweet potato pile, which took him about 15 minutes to finally get to the pile. He was chasing a doe when I shot him, moving target..I hit him just right he jumped like 9 feet straight up, hit the ground,kicked twice, and was dead.</p>

			<p>The coolest thing i have seen in nature was a baby rattle  snake that was curled up under a tree. It was extremely visiouse. Me and my friend Lexi grabed a bucket and a stick and put it into the bucket. We took the basketball that we were playing with and put it over the bucket so the snake could not get out. Then we showed the family and they started freaking out. They told us the go throw it into the woods, but we didnt listen so Lexis brother Daniel started going crazy and he choped it up into little pieces.</p>

			<p>When I think about the coolest thing i saw in nature i think about the time i ate honey suckles in the woods. Me and my sister and my cousins went into the woods to explore because we were bored and my cousins told me to eat it, so i did. I actually ate plenty of the honey suckles they offered me. The next morning however I was covered in red small bumps and I learned my lesson, and how my body reacts when I eat honeysuckles.</p>

			<p>The coolest thing I have ever seen in nature is the first time I went hunting. It was really cool I saw all sorts of animals, like deer, birds, squirrels, and rabbits. But then when the deer came out my daddy shot him and we went looking for him. It was really cool but when we got to the deer it still had nerves and it kept moving and it was kinda scary.</p>

			<p>The coolest thing that I ever seen in nature was when I was living with my mom and dad, I saw a snapping turtle and I thought it was a pile of dirt. I tried to pick it up but it snapped at me.<br />
	There was another time when I saw a opossum playing dead in my neighbors yard. I yelled and ran away because it moved, I thought it was dead, that&#8217;s why I screamed.</p>
