<h4>Poem</h4>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em>The prolific Irish poet William Butler Yeats is widely recognized as one of the greatest poets of the 20th century. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923. “To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Nothing” appeared in Poetry magazine nine years earlier.<br />
</em><br />

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Nothing</strong><br />
By William Butler Yeats</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Now all the truth is out,<br />
Be secret and take defeat<br />
From any brazen throat,<br />
For how can you compete,<br />
Being honor bred, with one<br />
Who were it proved he lies<br />
Were neither shamed in his own<br />
Nor in his neighbors&#8217; eyes;<br />
Bred to a harder thing<br />
Than Triumph, turn away<br />
And like a laughing string<br />
Whereon mad fingers play<br />
Amid a place of stone,<br />
Be secret and exult,<br />
Because of all things known<br />
That is most difficult.</p>

<h4>Times Selection Excerpt</h4>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In his article <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/us/29ttharrigan.html">&#8220;Novelist and His Hero Wonder, Will It Last?&#8221;</a> Christopher Kelly describes his work by referring to the Yeats poem we&#8217;ve published above:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To research his latest work of historical fiction, the post-World War I novel “Remember Ben Clayton,” the novelist and screenwriter Stephen Harrigan traveled to France twice so he could faithfully describe the town of Saint-Étienne and the battle that took place there in 1918. In Austin, where he lives, he spent hours poring over newspaper microfiche so he could write about what movies were playing at the time and what brands of chewing gum were being advertised. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For the novel’s central character, however, Mr. Harrigan did not need to dig as deeply into history. In writing about an aging yet still madly ambitious sculptor named Francis (Gil) Gilheaney, the 62-year-old Mr. Harrigan drew upon his own joys and frustrations as a Texas artist who has never been in fashion among the New York literary set, and who wonders if any of his work will still be read after he is gone.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I’ve always been taken by the Yeats poem ‘To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Nothing,’ ” Mr. Harrigan said. “I remember coming across that poem in college and thinking, ‘Oh, man, what a dire fate.’ And yet, every creative person wrestles with it. Has this been worth it? Am I going to be remembered?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Remember Ben Clayton” begins with Gil helplessly trying to protect one of his finest public sculptures from being destroyed by rioters in Oklahoma.

			<p>The poem and the article both refer to a key fear ingrained in the human mind: the fear of oblivion. it is in people&#8217;s nature to want to mark their existence, to make it seem worthy of their time, to make it matter. Leaving proof of my existence is a key component in the &#8220;point&#8221; of life, something that will last longer than my lifetime. Yeats&#8217; poem acknowledges this obsession with wanting to extend ones&#8217; life by leaving a trace, but interjects that any resistance to finite mortality is futile, because the most daunting task is to be content with accepting 1. death, 2. nothing is permanent, 3. mortality. The complementary article shows that Mr. Harrigan has not yet come to terms with impending oblivion and is scrambling through art to carve a scar into humanity that will stay open after his death. But a time will come where it is not only he that is dead, but the entire human race is forgotten. Shakespeare, Socrates, and the Beatles will all fade into oblivion, and our time period will not be comprised of individuals but of groups, where relevant differences of opinion today will compose one people, one mindset, in one period of time.</p>

			<p>There is a certain theme recurring throughout the poem and the excerpt of the article. Both the speaker in the poem and Mr.Harrigan in the article have a fear of being forgotten. Yeats&#8217; poem suggests that work does not count for anything if one is not remembered. Their belief is that hard work should mark your name in the world and the only way to show that you have done your part is by being remembered. I don&#8217;t agree with this theory. I believe that the only thing that matters is being satisfied with your own work and knowing that you yourself have done something great. Some of the greatest things in the world are unrecognized and I find that that is what makes it special and beautiful. Hard work counts when you know you&#8217;ve done your best, recognized or not. We all have fears; that&#8217;s what makes us human, but if you know you&#8217;ve done your best you won&#8217;t be forgotten.</p>

			<p>People have always tried to leave their mark on the world, no matter what it took. Martin Luther King Jr. will never be forgotten for something incredible, his stand against racism. Cleopatra became famous by just being beautiful. And Brutus will never be forgotten for something terrible, betraying Julius Caesar and stabbing him on stage. However some people struggle with the idea that one is not better than the other and just leaving their mark on this world is good enough for them. In “To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Nothing” and the article “Novelist and His Hero Wonder, Will It Last?”, we can see man’s struggle with feeling the need to leave his mark on this world before he is forgotten. Most men want to leave it doing something they love; something they feel is good, but unfortunately not all men. Just as Mr. Harrigan wonders if any of his work will still be read after he is gone, I wonder if someday I will be able to create something that is able to stand the test of time and not perish with me. But is it worth spending our whole lives trying to create something that will last longer than ourselves? After all, we will not be around to see it stay.</p>

			<p>Yeats&#8217; poem brings out a fear that every one has. We all worry that our lives will have come to mean nothing once we&#8217;re gone. We put so much work into things, and the idea that they disappear with us is scary. The Yeats poem focuses on how the person, the artist, feels, saying that one must just be happy with what you&#8217;ve done, be proud of your work. He also mentions that &#8220;that is the most difficult&#8221; thing to do.<br />
The Times selection is perfect next to this poem. More than just having referenced the poem itself, it talks about a WWI hero, an artist, and the man who wrote it. All three of these people fear being forgotten. The man who wrote the book spent a large amount of time and money researching battles, towns in France and even day to day life during  WWI. He also explores the artist&#8217;s need to keep is art around. The writer uses his own experience with the need to be remembered to write this part. The most subtle version of this fear comes through his exploration and research about WWI. Being almost 100 years ago, it&#8217;s not as fresh in student&#8217;s minds. While it is still one of the most important and influential moments of recent history, we need to keep the lessons of it alive, and the people who participated to save the world as we knew it must be remembered.<br />
This pairing explains that the fear is universal and an important part of literature, both in theme and seeded into it&#8217;s creation.</p>

			<p>To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Nothing by William Butler Yeats is a poem about accepting mockery and defeat. I believe that he is mostly referring to the artists, the creators. The artist’s creations are most directly in contact with a judging public. Therefore, they are at higher risk of criticism and mockery.  Dealing with that derisions and criticisms and people simply not accepting the work they’ve done is difficult and discouraging. Yeats advices the other poets to remain calm when facing those criticisms “from those brazen throats”. He says “be secret and take defeat”.  Yeats recognizes the bravery and the honor (“Being Honor bred”) in creating even though the product was not as successful. Yeats most of all advices the new and young artist to be “secret and exult”, calm and proud because that is what will help the artist go through failures. Yeats poem touches every artists fear and frustrations. And maybe not just artists. This could apply to anything and anyone who worked hard and did not achieve their goal. It could apply to students who studied very hand and failed a test. The poem pairs well with the poem because it provide a concrete example of the frustrations of an artist</p>

			<p>Yeats’ poem will survive through the years. We have all known frustration when work does not bear its fruits. It is something that no one can escape. There will always be a lack of recognition here or there, an assignment you stayed up all night completing that will never be seen or a refusal from a college you worked so hard to be accepted into. In these times, it is hardest to pick yourself up and carry on with your daily affairs. This poem perfectly sums up a feeling that so many have experienced and suffered. “To a Friend Whose Has Come to Nothing” is a poem of support, an ode to a forgotten effort; it is not, however, a pitiful poem. He offers his friend respect while trying to help him through a great disappointment.</p>

			<p>Everyone has a fear of being forgotten. This is why most humans have an innate obsession with making their mark on the world and making sure that they leave something behind so future generations can remember them. Memory is like the fountain of youth. One will always remain immortal if their memory is kept alive. Yeats addresses this in his poem and, through literary devices, shows that acceptance is key and to live a good life, one must accept death and the finality of life. It is man&#8217;s greatest task in life to understand what will one day happen to him. In the article paired with this poem, Harrigan has not completed this task yet. He struggles to understand this life lesson by spending his life and time attempting to leave his mark on the world. Mr. Harrigan needs to understand that one day, his memory won&#8217;t even matter, because there will be no world. Personally, I think people should be more focused on living life to the fullest every day and making memories for themselves rather than for history books. This poetry pairing is perfect because they convey the same ideas and even show examples of the point Yeats is trying to make.</p>

			<p>In the article, Stephen Harrington implies that he believes that the poem is about being forgotten anyhow hard that is. While I understand where this interpretation might come from, I do not believe that that is the main point behind the poem.<br />
It seems to me that the poem instead refers to defeat and the difficulty of accepting it. The poet seeks to teach his friend to take defeat in stride and to deal with it quietly despite how hard it is. The idea that you have to be able to deal with defeat without making it a big deal seems like something very important to me because the sooner you get past a failure, the sooner you are able to move on to your next victory. An example I can think of off the top of my head is basketball. When you screw up a defensive move, you need to be able to forget about it immediately or you&#8217;re likely to screw up the next one as well.</p>
