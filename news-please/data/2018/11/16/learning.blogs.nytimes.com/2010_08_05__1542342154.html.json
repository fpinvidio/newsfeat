Books like “The Catcher in the Rye” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” were favorites among teachers and students alike.\nTeachers also weighed in on the books they least enjoyed teaching. And “The Lord of the Flies” made the short list. Yet William Golding’s 1954 novel, which has been published in 26 languages and inspired two films, endures as required reading on high school and college campuses.\nSo, here are some resources to complement your reading of this classic text that we hope will help move it off of your, and your students’, “least favorite” lists. And teachers, we would love to hear how you teach “Lord of the Flies.” What works well?
