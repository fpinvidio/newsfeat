Barack Obama’s new Social Security proposal, love it or hate it, is huge news; it would push tax rates on some high-income Americans back to the levels of the 1970s.\nYet the proposal has received minimal media coverage — certainly as compared with the candidate’s Father’s Day speech, which was beautiful but didn’t have major policy implications.\nIf a candidate announces a major policy initiative but nobody hears about it, did it really happen?\nInstant update: I went over to the Tax Policy Center’s blog, and discovered that the Obama campaign is itself downplaying the initiative:\nThe campaign clarified that the threshold would be $250,000, but Senator Obama has not specified what the rate would be, when it would take effect, whether it would apply to employers, employees, or both, or what the tax base would be.\nUm, if the Obama campaign hasn’t figured out what this policy is, perhaps it would be best not to speak about it?", "url": "https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/16/campaign-coverage-puzzle/"}
