I am a pro-growth, free-market guy. I love the market.”\nfollowed by a rant against Jason Furman.\nLook, Obama didn’t pose as a Nation-type progressive, then turn on his allies after the race was won. Throughout the campaign he was slightly less progressive than Hillary Clinton on domestic issues — and more than slightly on health care. If people like Ms. Klein are shocked, shocked that he isn’t the candidate of their fantasies, they have nobody but themselves to blame.", "url": "https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/16/mundus-vult-decipi-ergo-decipiatur/"}
