It is the only Web site to offer brands like Anna Sui, Guiseppe Zanotti and Erdem at deeply discounted rates. Not to mention that it has the best discounted (if not the only) Alaïa available online. There is something for everyone on the Outnet: pick up hosiery for $8 or a Balmain dress for $4,000. Knowing when to shop is half the battle. Here’s a tip: New merchandise is updated here from 10 a.m. to noon daily. The Outnet offers “friends and family” sales to reward loyal customers. Also, the site’s unique “most wanted” list gives shoppers a second chance to buy pieces when they arrive back in stock. Take note: a special clearance sale on Friday will offer more than 2,000 styles at 85 percent off.", "url": "https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/26/online-shopping-time-zones/"}
