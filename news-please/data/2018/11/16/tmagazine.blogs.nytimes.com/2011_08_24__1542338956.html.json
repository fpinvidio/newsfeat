Having spent the last two years building the space and embracing naïveté and improvisation — letting the design of the tables “go where the wood wants to go,” for example — Somer has coined the term “primitive modernism” to describe the restaurant’s generally rustic look. “It speaks to that part of us that longs for something real, organic, dirty and alive,” he says, “that wants to pick up some rocks, logs, meat and cook over a fire.” The menu, by the chef Ignacio Mattos, formerly of Il Buco, goes to wonderfully unexpected places and features succulent, fall-off-the-bone pig’s tail, a bright consommé made with herbs from the restaurant’s roof garden and a cashew-dressed vegan salad that tastes curiously like a classic Caesar. Is that a rebellion against the comfort food that’s dominated New York tables? “This is the most fun I’ve had in nine years,” Somer says. “We’re trying things and making things. We just want to lose the fear, throw a little caution to the wind, dance badly and have a blast.”", "url": "https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/setting-the-table-isa-in-williamsburg/"}
