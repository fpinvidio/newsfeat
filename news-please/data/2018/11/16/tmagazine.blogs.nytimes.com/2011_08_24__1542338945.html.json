Fink works close — too close, no doubt, for the comfort of some of his very famous subjects, who appear alternately drunk, dazed and even a little bit scary in some of his pictures. As the official photographer for Vanity Fair’s Oscar shindig for roughly a decade, Fink has made Hollywood parties look as fatiguing as they are fabulous, and his aweless impressions are now collected in “The Vanities” (Schirmer/Mosel, $68). Here is Hugh Hefner, shot from the neck down, at a table with two amply bosomed bunnies. We see even less of Kate Moss (just the back of her legs in a crowd). Ethan Hawke slumps in front of Julie Delpy, who seems annoyed. “These photographs are glimpses of interactive citizens who happen to be idolized and coveted the world around,” Fink says. “But for me, they’re just folks.”", "url": "https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/all-access/"}
