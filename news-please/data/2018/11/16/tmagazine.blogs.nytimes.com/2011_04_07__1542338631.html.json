In a nod to the once-abundant greenery in this city, Marni has installed a courtyard oasis in front of its shop at Via Spiga 50.\n“We wanted to pay tribute to Italian flora and encourage the return of plants to our urban centers,” said Consuelo Castiglioni, the label’s designer, about the lavender, kitchen herbs and mulberry bushes that replaced the camellia trees that typically decorate the space.\nAnd even if the skies are gray this week, Marni has guaranteed spring: the artist Sara Rossi’s vernal film “Laterna Magica” will be projected on the walls.", "url": "https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/garden-shop-marni/"}
