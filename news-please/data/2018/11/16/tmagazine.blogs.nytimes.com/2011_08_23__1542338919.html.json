On the surface it operates as a classic barbershop, piles of shorn hair on the floor and all, but it also houses a secret speakeasy in the back room offering banquette seating, live D.J.’s and top-shelf whiskey. Now, not even their canisters of barbicide can be trusted. Teaming up with Joya, the New York company that makes all-natural fragrances for Rodarte and Opening Ceremony, the Bind Barber has crafted a signature soy wax candle that’s packaged to look just like the antiseptic used to keep combs and scissors minty fresh. Notes of lavender, smoke and leather echo the scents of an old-fashioned cut and shave. Now that’s sharp.\nSmall candle (6.2 ounces), $32, and large candle (22.8 ounces), $88. At the Blind Barber, 339 East 10th Street. Call (212) 228-2123.", "url": "https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/lighting-the-way/"}
