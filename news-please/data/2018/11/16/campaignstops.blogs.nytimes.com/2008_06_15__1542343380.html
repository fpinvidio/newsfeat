It wasn’t broadcast on television and only a few hundred Americans heard it in its entirety. But when presidential candidate Bill Clinton appeared at the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow Coalition on June 13, 1992, and attacked an obscure rapper named Sister Souljah it <a href="//campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/benign-neglect/index.html?ref=opinion">fundamentally changed the popular perception of the Democratic Party</a>.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Standing only a few feet from Mr. Jackson, Mr. Clinton excoriated the young rapper, who had said: “If black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people.” Mr. Clinton declared, “if you took the words white and black and reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech.” <span id="more-258"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">His words were crucial in recasting the image of the Democratic Party. For years, Democrats had been perceived as captives to a host of special interest groups, from labor and teachers’ unions to women’s and gay rights groups. But none were seen as more influential, and in many respects, as damaging to the party than African-Americans and their titular leader, Mr. Jackson. Today, as the Republican Party has become increasingly captive to its own collection of conservative special interest groups, the lesson of the Sister Souljah speech is one that the party needs to eagerly embrace. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When Clinton delivered his speech, Democrats were facing a credibility gap with voters: economic liberalism and government activism had become inextricably linked in the minds of millions of Americans to racial liberalism and identity politics — a linkage exploited by a generation of Republican politicians. From Richard Nixon’s law and order campaign in 1968 and Ronald Reagan’s rhetorical attacks on welfare queens to the odious Willie Horton ad in 1988, the G.O.P. had used coded language to exploit the nation’s racial fears and argue that Democrats were more attentive to their compendium of liberal interest groups than the middle class they once championed.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yet, with just a few words, Mr. Clinton’s “Sister Souljah moment” showed that he was willing to take on the party’s sacred cows and speak candidly to even the most entrenched party constituencies. The effect was palpable; in the words of one Philadelphia working-class voter, “the day he told off” Jesse Jackson “is the day he got my vote.” </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">(Indeed, just yesterday, Barack Obama had his own mini- &#8220;Souljah moment&#8221; as he decried the epidemic of fatherlessness and illegitimacy among black Americans. While it is a message that Mr. Obama has voiced before to other black audiences, speaking unpleasant truths about issues afflicting the black community may provide political benefit for a candidate whom some working-class white voters are suspicious of &#8212; just as it did for Clinton 16 years ago.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Over the next eight years, President Clinton would not only eliminate the party’s exposure to racial polarization, but by tackling welfare reform, crime and government spending he neutralized the party’s greatest vulnerabilities with white middle-class voters. At the same time, he defended affirmative action programs and pursued progressive economic and educational policies that did more to improve the lives of millions of African-Americans than 20 years of Democratic racial pandering.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Today, polls suggest that the American electorate prefers the Democratic Party on virtually every major domestic issue. If Barack Obama wanted to slap down a politically unhelpful liberal interest group he’d be hard pressed to find one. The same, however, cannot be said of the Republican Party and John McCain, and here is where Republicans could learn a great deal from Bill Clinton.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As social conservatives, foreign policy neo-conservatives and anti-tax and pro-business voices have come to dominate the G.O.P. coalition, the Republican Party has become as closely linked, both politically and in terms of policy, to their special interest groups as Democrats were to theirs in the ’70s, ’80s and early ’90s. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">John McCain’s political evolution, or possibly devolution, during the last eight years speaks volumes about the hold of these special interests. During his 2000 race for the Republican nomination, McCain openly derided the religious leaders Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, as agents of intolerance.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Today, he actively seeks the support of such far right religious figures and has delivered a number of major speeches in recent weeks that narrowly appeal to social conservative audiences, on topics from defending religious freedom to attacking activist judges. In 2001 and 2003, Mr. McCain voted against the Bush tax cuts, but today he apes the supply-side economic theory and militant anti-tax orthodoxy of Grover Norquist and Club for Growth. Like Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis in the 1980s, Mr. McCain has demonstrated little choice but to embrace the policy agenda of his party’s most prominent interest groups. His fealty to these groups not only limits his political mobility, but it threatens his once unimpeachable reformist image.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In 2000, John McCain declared of Republicans: “we are the party of Theodore Roosevelt, not the party of special interests.” But Roosevelt split from the G.O.P. because of its growing identification with the nation’s business trusts and its abandonment of progressive values. If Mr. McCain were the true descendant of Roosevelt, he would be running against the modern Republican Party and its special interests. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the short-term Mr. McCain’s moves may seem like smart politics; lock up the conservative base and spend the summer and fall reaching out to moderate voters. But as a generation of Democrats can testify, once the party gets into bed with its special interest groups it’s not easy to end the relationship. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As loath as it might be for John McCain, taking a page from Bill Clinton and delivering the type of speech he gave 16 years ago cannot come soon enough.</p>

			<p>Here&#8217;s the problem &#8212; while John McCain tries vainly to grasp onto the memory of his 2000 &#8220;maverick&#8221; campaign, he lets the creator of the 1988 Willie Horton ad start up a 527 to attack Sen. Obama as &#8220;weak on crime&#8221; based on &#8230; well, not much but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find some scary felon staring out from your television set soon. He has failed to distance himself from this guy so I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be seeing the fruits of his labor soon. And the not-so-subtle attacks on Michelle Obama don&#8217;t mesh with this image either. So it would be great for McCain to give a speech, but even more important for him to run his campaign in a way that showed bigotry was off base.</p>

			<p>It will take a lot more than a speech by John McCain to get people to buy the idea that somehow he&#8217;s going to be different from George W. Bush and the rest of the conservatives who rule the Republican party.</p>
<p>Bush&#8212;you may remember&#8212;also talked a very moderate game, back in 2000. We know what happened there.</p>
<p>John McCain and his people are deluding themselves if they think the many people will be fooled by a speech or two where he pretends to be different from the rest of the Republican Party. His positions are clear: Stay in Iraq indefinitely, back the Bush tax cuts, appoint ultra-right wingers to the Supreme Court, and possibly attack Iran. </p>
<p>A deceptive little speech won&#8217;t change those facts.</p>

			<p>John McCain cannot repudiate the special interests who control the Republican Party because those interest have BECOME the Republican Party. McCain is the GOP candidate because somewhere, somehow, the voters of this country broke ranks with the Republican script writers. But the money, power and prestige of the party remain securely locked up by the neo-cons and their Armageddon-seeking brethren. Perhaps once, long, long ago, John McCain was a free-thinking reformist. That was before he had a serious chance at the presidency. Now, too much is at stake. He will play the party&#8217;s hand, appealing to those who &#8212; after 8 terrifying years that  threatened the foundation of the very thing that made this nation great &#8212; still think GW Bush will go down in history as one of America&#8217;s greatest presidents. </p>
<p>I do not know what Barrack Obama will do to or for this nation if he wins in November. I do know what the Republican Party will do if John McCain wins, and that I cannot stomach. Bring on the change.</p>

			<p>Nice try, but I think McSame has already sunk himself too deep in those special interests in order to get the nomination. Any Sister Souljah speech right now would be seen as political opportunism rather than sincere.</p>

			<p>Mikie&#8230;you kidder.  Ascribing welfare reform to Willie when we all know he was brought along kicking &amp; whining.  And the Be Like Willie entreat.  Smoothe.  Conservatives are not a &#8216;special interest&#8217; group&#8230;we&#8217;re an American group with the preservation of basic principles foremost.  McCain ignores us at his peril.  Unlike the democrat AA victimhood cabal, our First Principles are about individual freedoms&#8230;not group supplication and dependence.  One only need observe the hinderance to AA progress the dem policies of the last 40 years have wrought.</p>
<p>Nice try.</p>

			<p>I believe in the coming election it is the Democratic, not Republican, Party which must address the question of being in thrall to a special interest group. There is little argument that if Senator Obama was white he would ever have been nominated with his far left agenda.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party is able to overlook intimidation and ballot stuffing, as in Gary, Indiana,in their own primaries in order to keep the black vote onside. The Democrats wish to make America a leading Third World power based on pandering to special interests.</p>

			<p>how dare you compare the likes of &#8220;christian&#8221; conservatives, neo-cons, and other true special interest groups with african americans, a racial minority that had been enslaved and disenfranchised for hundreds of years? the reason blacks were perceived to be a special interest group was because their citizenship rights, and their very humanity itself, had been denied since they were brought to this country in chains, and it took governmental intervention to provide them with the rights everyone else took for granted. the same cannot be said for the true special interest groups john mccain is now in bed with.</p>

			<p>McCain who claims to be a maverick and a straight talker, lacks the courage for this type of action.  He has morphed into just another pandering politician.  Likely he will not get elected, but if he does I can only hope he governs more as a centrist than as an idealogue.  But then again I am not optimistic.</p>

			<p>There&#8217;s a big difference here; Bill Clinton was extremely cynical when he gave the Sister Souljah speech; it was purely political &#8211; I don&#8217;t think he cared much one way or the other.  On the other hand, when McCain called Falwell and Robertson &#8220;agents of intolerance&#8221;, I think he really meant it; when he voted against the tax cuts, I think that came from a place of conviction.  Now, McCain has become cynical, a typical poll who would do or say anything to be President. Sound familiar?</p>

			<p>Must be because he dissed Jackson that Clinton is called America&#8217;s &#8220;1st Black President&#8221;.<br />
Really! the cynicism of that episode was palpable at the time and nothing written or said about it since then could change that judgment. It is on a par with other episodes of Liberal dissembling to con the white working class into thinking that the Liberals have changed their priorities and values; no such luck! The faux dissing of Sister Souljah was in the same spirit of other memorable  bits of Democratic theater, like Dukakis in the tank, Kerry&#8217;s salute and Hillary&#8217;s tears. The big difference of course, is that Bill Clinton is a better, more practiced, liar than the others (oh those lip bites!), with the possible exception of his wife.</p>

			<p>Interesting point. I&#8217;ve never considered voting Republican and will definitely vote for Obama this year, but hearing a major Republican give a strong speech telling religious conservatives that they need to accept scientific method and take a results-based position on sex education and public health would make me at least consider them as a party that I could eventually have something to do with&#8230; but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll see it anytime soon.</p>

			<p>1) Re Michael Cohen&#8217;s comment &#8220;Yet, with just a few words, Mr. Clinton’s “Sister Souljah moment” showed that he was willing to take on the party’s sacred cows and speak candidly to even the most entrenched party constituencies.&#8221; &#8212;</p>
<p>this claim is, of course, garbage when you look at Bill Clinton&#8217;s pandering to the Israel Lobby.</p>
<p>2) Again, Google &#8220;Haaretz&#8221; &#8220;Haim Saban&#8221; and &#8220;You Made It&#8221; to find Haim Saban&#8217;s Dec 2006 interview with Israel&#8217;s Haaretz.  In which Saban boasted of how PRESIDENT Bill Clinton fetched soft drinks to Saban whenever Saban visited the White House.  </p>
<p>How strongly did President Bill Clinton stand up to the Israel Lobby&#8217;s influence &#8212; and to lobbying from Israel&#8217;s Likud Government &#8212; when it came to PARDONING criminal Marc Rich?</p>
<p>3) So yeah, Southern governor Bill Clinton played the race card and kicked the blacks around.  But President Bill Clinton also screwed a lot of whites in Appalachia during his administration &#8212; which explains why that area went for George Bush in 2000.  </p>
<p>Jesse Jackson is the ONLY politican who has ever stood up for poor white people as well as for poor black people.</p>
<p>By contrast, Bill Clinton&#8217;s entire political life has been a monument to whoring for rich factions while deceitfully pretending to be a tribune for the common man.</p>
<p>4) I say this as a White Man reared in  Southern Appalachia.   Jesse Jackson has his faults &#8212; but he is worth TEN Bill Clintons.</p>

			<p>This is silly. The Republican party has to stand for something different than the Democrat party. We stand for low taxes, religious freedom, economic freedom and freedom for people around the world. Supporting those views is not supporting special interest groups.

			<p>Yet McCain&#8217;s failure to take on such interest groups hasn&#8217;t cost him a thing &#8211; he still runs practically neck and neck with Obama in polls. By the same token, since he operates in a racist society, his association with Hagee and Parsley hasn&#8217;t cost him anywhere near what Obama association with Wright has cost him. And the same way his comments about it being &#8220;very tough&#8221; (or something along those lines) to be proud of your country has barely been commented upon, while Michelle Obama&#8217;s comments are practically the first thing anyone mentions about her.</p>

			<p>A breath-taking post by Mr. Cohen. </p>
<p>A) McCain again and again speaks his opposition to the beliefs of huge chunks of the Republican electorate &#8211; Cap &amp; Trade, obscene profits, a general disdain for the private sector. If he has reached out to evangelicals, it is in a most perfunctory way.</p>
<p>B) To imply that Bill Clinton shed special interest groups from the Democrats is laughable. </p>
<p>C) It is also worth noting that during the Clinton administration, the Democrats lost control of both houses of Congress and 9 governorships. Bill Clinton took care of Bill Clinton, not the Democratic party. That is obviously what Mr. Cohen hopes for John McCain to do &#8211; employ a strategy that might benefit John McCain while severely injuring an already damaged party.</p>

			<p>&#8220;If Barack Obama wanted to slap down a politically unhelpful liberal interest group he’d be hard pressed to find one.&#8221;</p>
<p>   What about the teacher&#8217;s unions, who throttle education reform wherever they find it?</p>

			<p>Did you listen to Barack Obama&#8217;s Father&#8217;s Day Speech yesterday?  It was another Souljah moment for the Democratsand McCain will have an impossibly hard time indeed topping it.</p>
<p>Might as well give up now.</p>

			<p>It is sad to see Michael Cohen celebrate Bill Clinton&#8217;s cop-out on race during the culture wars of the early 90s. At a time when hip hop became the focal point for insidious racial stereotypes about black Americans, the incident represented the tendency among Democrats and Republicans to use cultural anxieties to cover over the structural inequities that continue to reinforce racial inequities. Given Obama&#8217;s speech yesterday that legitimized certain racial and gender stereotypes regarding black families, it is vital to distinguish the racial paranoia of the culture wars from issues such as McCain&#8217;s special interest support. Specified racial minorities should not be seen as &#8220;special interests&#8221; separated from a white majority.</p>

			<p>Michael Cohen&#8217;s analysis is wrong for several reasons.</p>
<p>0. Bill Clinton only got 42% of the vote. Had it not been for former Republican turned populist libertarian Ross Perot draining away conservative voters PLUS an internal split within the Republican Party PLUS a bad economy (part of it caused by George H. W. Bush&#8217;s dismantling the no longer needed Cold War military machine, which incidentally was the right thing to do economically, as was Bush&#8217;s decision to bite the bullet on the savings and loans scandal) Clinton would have lost.<br />
1. Cohen significantly overstates the popularity of Democratic policies.<br />
2. As Bill Clinton actually quoted Sister Souljah out of context, Cohen is claiming that Clinton&#8217;s pandering to liberal white racists in order to get elected was the right thing to do. And further, Hillary Clinton was clearly the victim of Bill Clinton&#8217;s &#8220;triangulation&#8221; this primary season when black voters finally decided that they had suffered enough indignities.<br />
3. Clinton only sacrificed the least popular and most expedient portion of his supporters; people who felt that they had no choice but to support the Democrats because the Republicans were so hostile to them. So with cruel treatment like that from &#8220;friends&#8221; like Clinton, who needs enemies? Clinton did not throw feminists, gay rights activists, environmentalists, etc. under the bus the way he repeatedly did with black voters.<br />
4. So the fact that Clinton&#8217;s policies benefitted some blacks made his race &#8211; baiting and pandering to racists OK? Why doesn&#8217;t Richard Nixon (who created affirmative action and enterprise zones to begin with) and Ronald Reagan (blacks made great economic and social gains during his administration) get the same benefit? This is especially the case of Nixon, who over the course of his career as a Congressman, Senator, vice president, and president did more for civil rights than John Kennnedy, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton COMBINED. </p>
<p>Bottom line: if John McCain&#8217;s conservative base does not turn out, he has no chance. He might make it LOOK close and win a lot of states and electoral votes, but the reality is that without social and economic conservatives a GOPer cannot sweep Ohio, Missouri, and Colorado.</p>

			<p>So everybody is embracing McCain&#8217;s &#8220;maverick&#8221; image.  If I read my history right, wasn&#8217;t Maverick a cattle thief, basically stealing the Commons for his own use?</p>

			<p>The author fails to bring any examples of outrages comparable to &#8220;let&#8217;s kill whites for a week&#8221; that John McCain should be dis-associating from. </p>
<p>&#8220;let&#8217;s cut taxes for a week&#8221; is not comparable</p>
