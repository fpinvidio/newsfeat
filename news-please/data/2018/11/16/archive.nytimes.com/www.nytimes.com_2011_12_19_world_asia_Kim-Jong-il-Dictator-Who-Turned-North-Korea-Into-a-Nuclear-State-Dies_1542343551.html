                                        saw the outside world, save from the windows of his luxury train, which occasionally took him to China. </p>

                                        Ms. Albright met Mr. Kim in October 2000 in what turned out to be a futile effort to strike a deal with North Korea over limiting its missile program before President Bill Clinton left office. </p>

                                        President Bush said during his first term in office that he would never tolerate a nuclear North Korea, but as his presidency wound down, many of his aides believed he did exactly that. </p>

                                        It was not until the spring of 2007 that Mr. Bush was told by the Israelis that North Korea was helping Syria build a nuclear reactor; before the Syrians or the North Koreans were confronted with that evidence, Israel sent bombers on a secret mission
                                        to destroy the Syrian plant. The North Koreans have never explained their role. </p>

                                        By the time Mr. Bush left office, the administration had moved from four years of confrontation with the North to three years of halting negotiations. Led by Christopher R. Hill, a veteran American diplomat, the negotiations resulted in a deal that hawks
                                        hated: the United States agreed to supply North Korea with large amounts of fuel oil in return for the dismantlement of the aging Yongbyon plant, described by inspectors as a radioactive accident waiting to happen.

                                        Mr. Kim played a weak hand very well. He succeeded in fending off pressure from Washington and Beijing, and forcing Washington to talk with him and ultimately to haggle with him. He chopped up and dragged out negotiations, holding on to his nuclear fuel
                                        and whatever weapons he had produced, giving him continued leverage. It is that arsenal that now worries American and Asian officials, who fear that plotting generals and party leaders may fight to control it as

                                        Mr. Kim is believed to have been born in Siberia in 1941, when his father, Kim Il-sung, was in exile in the Soviet Union. But in North Korea&#x2019;s official accounts, he was born in 1942, in a cabin, Abe Lincoln-like. The cabin was in a secret camp
                                        of anti-Japanese guerrillas his father commanded on Mount Paektu, a holy piece of land in Korean mythology. The event, the official Korean Central News Agency would often say, was accompanied by the appearance of

                                        Little is known of his upbringing, apart from the official statement that he graduated in 1964 from Kim Il-sung University, one of the country&#x2019;s many monuments to his father. At the time, North Korea was enmeshed in the cold war, and the younger
                                        Kim watched many crises unfold from close up, including North Korea&#x2019;s seizure of the Pueblo, an American spy ship, in 1968. He appeared episodically at state events, rarely speaking. When he did, he revealed
                                        a high-pitched voice and little of his father&#x2019;s easygoing charisma. </p>

                                        In his youth and middle age, there were stories about his playboy lifestyle. There were tales of lavish meals at a time his country was starving &#x2014; his cook wrote a book after leaving the country &#x2014; and his wavy hair and lifted heels, along

                                        In 1994, in a showdown with the United States, North Korea threatened to turn its stockpile of nuclear fuel into bombs. It was the closest the two countries came to war since the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. The standoff was defused when
                                        Kim Il-sung welcomed former President Jimmy Carter, who pushed Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kim into a deal. </p>

                                        Within a month, however, the country&#x2019;s founder and Great Leader was dead. Many doubted at the time that the younger Kim would take over. There were rumors of a military coup, and theories that he would be allowed to keep his fast cars and to consort
                                        with visiting European &#x201C;entertainers&#x201D; as long as he did not try to run the country. Like much intelligence about North Korea, that turned out to be wrong. </p>

                                        Mr. Kim has three sons, any of whom could potentially have succeeded him. But his home life is a mystery. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        His oldest son, Kim Jong-nam, would have been the natural choice to succeed him. But he had a handicap: his mother never married Mr. Kim. Since his health crisis, in 2008, Mr. Kim had been grooming his third son, Kim Jong-un, believed to be in his late
                                        20s, to be his successor. Reports from North Korea on Monday suggested that Kim Jong-un was in charge. </p>

                                        Mr. Kim consolidated power in the late 1990s, and flexed his muscle by testing a North Korean missile over Japan, sending that much larger and more powerful nation into a panic. It was through episodes like this that Mr. Kim learned true power: that he
                                        could blackmail his way to survival. </p>

                                        But he could not learn to feed his own people, and his country became even more dependent on China for food and fuel and on &#x201C;humanitarian&#x201D; donations from South Korea and the United States. In June 2000, Mr. Kim played host in Pyongyang,
                                        the North&#x2019;s capital, to the first summit meeting with a South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, since the peninsula was divided more than five decades before. </p>

                                        Once President Bush took office in January 2001, all cooperation between Washington and Seoul over how to deal with the North came to a crashing halt. Mr. Bush rejected the South&#x2019;s &#x201C;sunshine policy&#x201D; of engagement with North Korea,
                                        and ended Clinton-era talks that he viewed as dangerous appeasement. </p>

                                        A concerted effort began to push North Korea over the brink, and set off an uprising against Kim Jong-il&#x2019;s leadership. To the degree Washington could, it cut off North Korean trade, its access to cash and its ability to export weapons and drugs.
                                        Mr. Bush called Mr. Kim a &#x201C;tyrant&#x201D; who &#x201C;starves his own people.&#x201D; </p>

                                        In October 2002, the administration presented North Korea with evidence that it had secretly tried to evade the 1994 nuclear agreement with the United States by purchasing equipment to enrich uranium from Abdul Qadeer Khan, a founder of Pakistan&#x2019;s
                                        nuclear weapons program. The evidence was strong &#x2014; the United States had tracked the shipments with spy satellites &#x2014; but the C.I.A. overstated its confidence that the North was building separate, secret
                                        nuclear facilities. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        That led to a confrontation that changed the nature of the North Korean threat. Mr. Kim ordered the ouster of United Nations inspectors who had been stationed at Yongbyon. The United States pressed for an end to fuel shipments to the North. In retaliation,
                                        from January through March 2003, just as the United States military was barreling toward the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Kim did what his father had come so very close to doing nine years before: he announced that he
                                        was reprocessing spent fuel rods into bomb fuel. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        After the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Kim was not seen for nearly two months; there were reports that he had gone into hiding, thinking he was Mr. Bush&#x2019;s next target. He emerged only to start another confrontation in 2006, first with a series of missile
                                        tests, then, in October, the North&#x2019;s first nuclear test. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        Some Asian and American officials interpreted Mr. Kim&#x2019;s decision as a fit of pique because &#x201C;six-party talks&#x201D; &#x2014; negotiations among North Korea, China, South Korea, Russia, the United States and Japan &#x2014; were moving so
                                        slowly. Others said that Mr. Kim had simply learned from Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s mistakes and determined that he would never face the United States without a nuclear weapon. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        The test itself was something of a fizzle; it ended with a sub-kiloton explosion, less than a tenth of the power of the bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. But Mr. Kim had made his point. He was condemned in the United Nations, and China
                                        briefly cut off oil and other trade. But within months the United States agreed on a new series of negotiations. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        While there were many starts and stops, and disagreements over what it means to fully dismantle a nuclear program, in the summer of 2007 Mr. Kim agreed to stop the production of new nuclear fuel at Yongbyon. By then he presumably had all the weapons he
                                        needed. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        The plant began to be dismantled, and in the summer of 2008 the Bush administration talked about starting up with Mr. Kim on the hardest negotiations of all, over the price of giving up North Korea&#x2019;s nuclear arsenal. He died before the talks could
                                        seriously begin. . </p>

                                        As soon as President Obama came into office, Mr. Kim ordered a second nuclear test, this one more successful than the first. And he waited out the predictable hail of international condemnation. The move aborted efforts by Mr. Obama to engage with the
                                        North Koreans. And the next three years were spent with the United States and South Korea demanding the North live up to the denuclearization pledges it made during the Bush administration. </p>

                                        Instead, it did the opposite. In November 2010, the North Koreans showed a visiting American scientist from Stanford University, Siegfried Hecker, <a title="Times article" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-reactor-progress.html">an apparently working uranium enrichment plant</a>                                        that the country had been building for years, and that the C.I.A. had missed, though the agency had been right about other secret facilities. The plant gave North Korea a new way to produce nuclear weapons, even
                                        as his people fell into another food shortage. </p>

                                        The same year, the North made two attacks against the South Korean military, sinking a ship and later shelling an island near Northern waters. The episodes caused the United States and South Korea to conduct new joint exercises, even while the Chinese,
                                        apparently fearing a complete collapse of the North Korean regime, increased its economic aid. </p>

                                        him on the trip. </p>
