                                                            and unfeeling. But his sharp critique of the mayor also doubles as an attack on Ms. Quinn, Mr. Bloomberg&#x2019;s partner in government and Mr. de Blasio&#x2019;s chief rival for the liberal
                                                            white vote. For him to succeed, she must fail. Watch for him to portray her as an unprincipled Bloomberg-lite. His election requires a carefully assembled coalition: Quinn-wary progressives in
                                                            Manhattan and brownstone Brooklyn and ethnic voters drawn to the Italian-American candidate and his wife, who is of Caribbean descent. Voters seeking more than simplistic answers are attracted
                                                            to his sophistication and thoughtfulness. But public advocates have a poor record of becoming mayor, and the presence of an Asian and an African-American candidate in the primary complicates
                                                            his path.</p>

                                                            the private sector, significantly diminishing his public profile and giving this year&#x2019;s run a quixotic quality. But he offers a sophisticated set of policies on transportation and education

                                                            and in hurricane-battered areas like the Rockaways. And marijuana smokers. He wants to legalize and tax it, though he insists he has never smoked it.</p>

                                                            inevitable third term is now working with her, citing a d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu lead in polls. But in a multicandidate field, the race is less predictable. Her plan is to monopolize Manhattan, her
                                                            home turf, turn out large numbers of female and gay voters and build from there. Watch for her to court Latino women from Washington Heights in Manhattan, Jews from Forest Hills, Queens, and

                                                            who hate the mayor and those who resent the term-limits deal she struck to guarantee him a third term. Her get-it-done-by-any-means style holds a distinct appeal in the post-partisan age of Bloomberg.
                                                            But the real risk, as she strains to be a palatable candidate to big business, labor unions and the billionaire mayor, is that New Yorkers will have no idea what she stands for.</p>

                                                            in a single day. To the head-scratchers puzzled by the notion that he could ever be elected, his campaign points out that his hold on Asian voters, who catapulted him to citywide office in 2009,

                                                        <p>The billionaire who lives on Fifth Avenue really just wants to be the guy down the block &#x2014; a Main Street Bloomberg, rumpled and relatable. His advisers plan to put his biography &#x2014; as
                                                            an up-from-the-bootstraps Greek immigrant &#x2014; at the center of his campaign, arguing that it will appeal to the outer-borough Italian, German and Irish voters in the Republican Party who
                                                            feel left behind by an Upper East Side mayor. But his political strategy is Bloomberg&#x2019;s, through and through: self-financing a campaign and claiming that his poorer rivals are susceptible
                                                            to influence-peddling. To undercut his leading Republican rival, Joseph J. Lhota, Mr. Catsimatidis will portray him as the toll-hiking enemy of Staten Island, the city&#x2019;s Republican capital.
                                                            The rest, his strategists say, is up to the Democrats: if he faces a white candidate in the general election, they believe he can build a potent coalition of black, Latino and Asian voters who
                                                            see his story as theirs. But it is unclear that Mr. Catsimatidis is willing to spend what it takes to win even the Republican primary, or whether any amount of money can overcome his limitations
                                                            as a candidate. He is prone to oddball suggestions (putting police officers on tricycles), oratorical excesses (he compared President Obama&#x2019;s taxing the rich to the way &#x201C;Hitler
                                                            punished the Jews&#x201D;) and amateurish slip-ups (he called for the creation of a technology district in New York called Silicon Alley, even though such a cluster already existed with that

                                                            convinced of his electability, but he makes this argument: in a three-way race, he needs about 500,000 votes. Assuming he can bring back the Independence Party&#x2019;s 150,000 votes in 2009
                                                            and win half of the city&#x2019;s Latino voters, he is up to nearly 300,000. But persuading Latino voters to abandon the Democratic Party may be a Sisyphean pursuit, and without Mr. Bloomberg

                                                            earned him a $10,000 fine from the city&#x2019;s Conflicts of Interest Board.</p>

These are not happening. He is left running the loneliest mayoral campaign in modern memory, which actually suits him. After begging the electorate for a second chance to serve, Mark Sanford-style, he is expected to exploit his independence by running as a Kochian Democrat, well to the right of his rivals, whom he will paint as babbling machine liberals unprepared to fight for the vanishing middle class. His toughest sell, given his Twitter troubles, will be female voters, but his polished wife, Huma Abedin, has shown an aptitude for softening his edges. He is banking that a combination of staggering name recognition in the polls, combined with his image as a Man of Ideas (there are 64 of them in his &ldquo;Keys to the City&rdquo; book) will peel off enough uninspired voters to propel him into a runoff. Then, win or lose, his journey of redemption is over. ",

His campaign is a frontal assault on the Bloomberg era &mdash; as being unfair, undemocratic and unfeeling. But his sharp critique of the mayor also doubles as an attack on Ms. Quinn, Mr. Bloomberg&rsquo;s partner in government and Mr. de Blasio&rsquo;s chief rival for the liberal white vote. For him to succeed, she must fail. Watch for him to portray her as an unprincipled Bloomberg-lite. His election requires a carefully assembled coalition: Quinn-wary progressives in Manhattan and brownstone Brooklyn and ethnic voters drawn to the Italian-American candidate and his wife, who is of Caribbean descent. Voters seeking more than simplistic answers are attracted to his sophistication and thoughtfulness. But public advocates have a poor record of becoming mayor, and the presence of an Asian and an African-American candidate in the primary complicates his path.",

Since then, he has worked in the private sector, significantly diminishing his public profile and giving this year&rsquo;s run a quixotic quality. But he offers a sophisticated set of policies on transportation and education that will make for a smarter Democratic debate. He argues that he can lure votes from Staten Island, a borough he carried in the 1997 primary; his former Council district in southwest Brooklyn; and in hurricane-battered areas like the Rockaways. And marijuana smokers. He wants to legalize and tax it, though he insists he has never smoked it.",

Bloomberg&rsquo;s inevitable third term is now working with her, citing a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu lead in polls. But in a multicandidate field, the race is less predictable. Her plan is to monopolize Manhattan, her home turf, turn out large numbers of female and gay voters and build from there. Watch for her to court Latino women from Washington Heights in Manhattan, Jews from Forest Hills, Queens, and Irish Catholics from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, whose enthusiasm for a lesbian candidate is untested. She has all but written off two groups that represent about a quarter of the electorate: voters who hate the mayor and those who resent the term-limits deal she struck to guarantee him a third term. Her get-it-done-by-any-means style holds a distinct appeal in the post-partisan age of Bloomberg. But the real risk, as she strains to be a palatable candidate to big business, labor unions and the billionaire mayor, is that New Yorkers will have no idea what she stands for.",

Mr. Liu is running for mayor. If any candidate can be called indefatigable, it is he: a long-distance runner in high school, he is a 24-hour-a-day political machine, known for squeezing in services with Baptists and Presbyterians on the same morning and holding 15 events in a single day. To the head-scratchers puzzled by the notion that he could ever be elected, his campaign points out that his hold on Asian voters, who catapulted him to citywide office in 2009, remains undisturbed. By visiting a mosque every Friday, he has made unexpected inroads with the city&rsquo;s long-neglected Muslims. His least understood asset, however, is the deep bond he has forged with the city&rsquo;s black community, which has applauded his call for the abolition of the Police Department&rsquo;s stop-and-frisk tactic and his complaints about prosecutorial zeal. The long-running probe into his campaign finances will keep many big-name elected officials, labor groups and editorial boards from endorsing him, but their snubs may fuel his reputation as a fearless outsider. Next to Ms. Quinn, he is the most natural politician in the race, quick to deliver bruising jabs and deft at reading crowds.",

Strip out the mad-as-hell protest vote over term limits, which turbocharged his 2009 candidacy, and his odds look even longer this time around. But here&rsquo;s what his team is telling would-be supporters: he will create a modernized Dinkins-like mosaic, carrying still-ardent African-Americans and attracting the ascendant Latino voting bloc, even as he builds a bridge to the city&rsquo;s corporate crowd. (One example: his measured approach to the polarizing police tactic called stop and frisk.) By zeroing in on their needs, he has quietly established allies within the Orthodox Jewish community, a prized slice of the electoral pie. He is trying to convince skeptical donors that he has fire in the belly despite a sometimes retiring style. But rather than turning up the energy, lately he has been turning up the volume, shouting zingers and pounding tables.",

As former head of the transit authority and a deputy mayor in the administration of Rudolph W. Giuliani, he can credibly claim to have run a bureaucracy as big and messy as New York City&rsquo;s, a rarity in this year&rsquo;s field. But both jobs invite obvious (and potent) attacks &mdash; rivals will paint him as a fare-hiking disciple of a megalomaniacal mayor. He has plenty of political chits to cash in: Staten Islanders will remember his role in closing the Fresh Kills landfill, a festering eyesore; Manhattanites will recall the plunging crime rate under Mr. Giuliani; and everyone else will be reminded of the rapid restoration of subway service after Hurricane Sandy. To the disappointment of some friends, Candidate Lhota has traded in a once-freewheeling and colorful personality for a staid and careful style. His real worry is his billionaire Republican opponent. But his advisers regard Mr. Catsimatidis as they did another rival from their past, Ron Lauder, who lost the Republican primary to Mr. Giuliani in 1989, as a wealthy but ineffectual nuisance.",

His advisers plan to put his biography &mdash; as an up-from-the-bootstraps Greek immigrant &mdash; at the center of his campaign, arguing that it will appeal to the outer-borough Italian, German and Irish voters in the Republican Party who feel left behind by an Upper East Side mayor. But his political strategy is Bloomberg&rsquo;s, through and through: self-financing a campaign and claiming that his poorer rivals are susceptible to influence-peddling. To undercut his leading Republican rival, Joseph J. Lhota, Mr. Catsimatidis will portray him as the toll-hiking enemy of Staten Island, the city&rsquo;s Republican capital. The rest, his strategists say, is up to the Democrats: if he faces a white candidate in the general election, they believe he can build a potent coalition of black, Latino and Asian voters who see his story as theirs. But it is unclear that Mr. Catsimatidis is willing to spend what it takes to win even the Republican primary, or whether any amount of money can overcome his limitations as a candidate. He is prone to oddball suggestions (putting police officers on tricycles), oratorical excesses (he compared President Obama&rsquo;s taxing the rich to the way &ldquo;Hitler punished the Jews&rdquo;) and amateurish slip-ups (he called for the creation of a technology district in New York called Silicon Alley, even though such a cluster already existed with that very name).",

A longtime Democrat, he has switched his registration to unaffiliated, a Bloomberg-style maneuver that has secured him a spot on the city&rsquo;s small but attractively named Independence Party ballot line and guaranteed him a place in the general election. Not even he seems entirely convinced of his electability, but he makes this argument: in a three-way race, he needs about 500,000 votes. Assuming he can bring back the Independence Party&rsquo;s 150,000 votes in 2009 and win half of the city&rsquo;s Latino voters, he is up to nearly 300,000. But persuading Latino voters to abandon the Democratic Party may be a Sisyphean pursuit, and without Mr. Bloomberg &mdash; and his $120 million budget &mdash; on the Independence ballot, there is little evidence that the party can lure back all of those voters. What Mr. Carri&oacute;n needs is a deep reservoir of charisma and an unblemished r&eacute;sum&eacute;. But his presence behind a lectern is technocratic. And his two-year delay in paying for home remodeling work done by a well-connected architect earned him a $10,000 fine from the city&rsquo;s Conflicts of Interest Board.",
