                                        OAKLAND, Calif. &#x2014; The kitchen counter in the home of the Hayes family is scattered with the inhalers, sprays and bottles of pills that have allowed Hannah, 13, and her sister, Abby, 10, to excel at dance and gymnastics despite a horrific pollen
                                        season that has set off asthma attacks, leaving the girls struggling to breathe. </p>

                                        Asthma &#x2014; the most common chronic disease that affects Americans of all ages, about 40 million people &#x2014; can usually be well controlled with drugs. But being able to afford prescription medications in the United States often requires top-notch
                                        insurance or plenty of disposable income, and time to hunt for deals and bargains. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        The arsenal of medicines in the Hayeses&#x2019; kitchen helps explain why. Pulmicort, a steroid inhaler, generally retails for over $175 in the United States, while pharmacists in Britain buy the identical product for about $20 and dispense it free of
                                        charge to asthma patients. Albuterol, one of the oldest asthma medicines, typically costs $50 to $100 per inhaler in the United States, but it was less than $15 a decade ago, before it was repatented. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        &#x201C;The one that really blew my mind was the nasal spray,&#x201D; said Robin Levi, Hannah and Abby&#x2019;s mother, referring to her $80 co-payment for Rhinocort Aqua, a prescription drug that was selling for more than $250 a month in Oakland pharmacies
                                        last year but costs under $7 in Europe, where it is available over the counter. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts the annual cost of asthma in the United States at more than $56 billion, including millions of potentially avoidable hospital visits and more than 3,300 deaths, many involving patients who skimped on
                                        medicines or did without. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        &#x201C;The thing is that asthma is so fixable,&#x201D; said Dr. Elaine Davenport, who works in Oakland&#x2019;s Breathmobile, a mobile asthma clinic whose patients often cannot afford high prescription costs. &#x201C;All people need is medicine and education.&#x201D;

                                        With its high prescription prices, the United States spends far more per capita on medicines than other developed countries. Drugs account for 10 percent of the country&#x2019;s $2.7 trillion annual health bill, even though the average American takes
                                        fewer prescription medicines than people in France or Canada, said Gerard Anderson, who studies medical pricing at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        Americans also use more generic medications than patients in any other developed country. The growth of generics has led to cheap pharmacy specials &#x2014; under $7 a month &#x2014; for some treatments for high cholesterol and high blood pressure, as
                                        well as the popular sleeping pill Ambien. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        But many generics are still expensive, even if insurers are paying the bulk of the bill. Generic Augmentin, one of the most common antibiotics, retails for $80 to $120 for a 10-day prescription ($400 for the brand-name version). Generic Concerta, a mainstay
                                        of treating attention deficit disorder, retails for $75 to $150 per month, even with pharmacy discount coupons. For some conditions, including asthma, there are few generics available. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="articleBody">
                                        While the United States is famous for break-the-bank cancer drugs, the high price of many commonly used medications contributes heavily to health care costs and certainly causes more widespread anguish, since many insurance policies offer only partial

                                        For decades, the backbone of treatment for asthma has centered on inhaled medicines. The first step is a bronchodilator, which relaxes the muscles surrounding small airways to open them. For people who use this type of rescue inhaler frequently, doctors
                                        add an inhaled steroid as a maintenance drug to prevent inflammation and ward off attacks. The two medicines are often mixed in a single combination inhaler for adults, and these products are especially pricey.
                                        In addition, many patients, particularly children, take pills as well as nasal sprays that calm allergies that set off the condition. </p>

                                        For most patients, asthma medicines are life-changing. In economic terms, that means demand for the medicines is inelastic. Unlike a treatment for acne that a patient might drop if the price became too high, asthma patients will go to great lengths to
                                        obtain their drugs. </p>

                                        for $250 to $350 in the United States. </p>

                                        health insurance will pick up a significant part of the cost. An average co-payment for Advair for commercially insured patients is $30 to $45 a month, he added. </p>

                                        but the final tally is not clear because the insurer contracts with Medco, a prescription benefits company that negotiates with drug makers for undisclosed discounts. </p>

                                        Aravosis, 49, a political blogger in Washington, buys a few Advair inhalers at $45 each during vacations in Paris, since his insurance caps prescription coverage at $1,500 per year. Sharon Bondroff, 68, an antiques
                                        dealer in Maine on Medicare, scrounges samples of Advair from local doctors. Ms. Bondroff remembers a time, not so long ago, when inhalers &#x201C;were really cheap.&#x201D; The sticker shock for asthma patients
                                        began several years back when the federal government announced that it would require manufacturers of spray products to remove chlorofluorocarbon propellants because they harmed the environment. That meant new inhaler
                                        designs. And new patents. And skyrocketing prices. </p>

                                        &#x201C;That decision bumped out the generics,&#x201D; said Dr. Peter Norman, a pharmaceutical consultant based in Britain who specializes in respiratory drugs. &#x201C;Suddenly sales of the branded products went right back up, and since then it has not
                                        been a very competitive market.&#x201D; </p>

                                        The chlorofluorocarbon ban even eliminated Primatene Mist inhalers, a cheap over-the-counter spray of epinephrine that had many unpleasant side effects but was at least an effective remedy for those who could not afford prescription treatments. </p>

                                        As drugs age and lose patent protection, the costs of treatment can fall significantly because of generic competition &#x2014; particularly if a pill has only one active ingredient and is simple to replicate. When Singulair, a pill the Hayes girls take
                                        daily to block allergic reactions in the lungs, lost its patent protection last year, generics rapidly entered the market. The price of the drug has already dropped from $180 per month to as low as $15 to $20 with

                                        But sprays, creams, patches, gels and combination medicines are more difficult to copy exactly to make a generic that meets Food and Drug Administration standards. Each time a molecule is put in a new inhaler or combined with another medicine, the amount
                                        delivered into the lungs or through the skin may change, even though that often has an imperceptible effect on patients. </p>

                                        &#x201C;Drug companies can switch devices and use different combinations, and it becomes quite difficult to demonstrate equivalence,&#x201D; Dr. Norman said, adding that inhaler makers have exploited such barriers to increase sales of medicines long after
                                        the scientific novelty has passed. </p>

                                        of generic inhaled medicines was the agency&#x2019;s highest priority but that the effort had been stalled because of budget cuts imposed by Congress. </p>

                                        Even so, experts say, a significant problem is that none of the agencies that determine whether medicines come to market in the United States are required to consider patient access, affordability or need. </p>

                                        For example, with the patent for the older oral contraceptive Loestrin 24Fe about to expire, the company Warner Chilcott stopped making the pill this year and introduced a chewable version &#x2014; with a new patent and an expensive promotional campaign
                                        urging patients and doctors to switch. While many insurance plans covered the popular older drug with little or no co-payment, they often exclude the new pills, leaving patients covering the full monthly cost of
                                        about $100. Patients complained that the new pills tasted awful and were confused about whether they could just be swallowed. </p>

                                        For asthma patients in the United States, the best the market has yielded are a few faux generics that are often only marginally cheaper than the brand-name versions. AstraZeneca, for example, has an agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals, a generic manufacturer,
                                        to make an approved generic version of its Pulmicort Respules, an asthma medicine for home inhalation treatments. Teva paid AstraZeneca more than $250 million last year in royalties to make a generic, which sells
                                        for about $200 for a typical monthly dose, compared with close to $300 for the branded product. </p>

                                        There are good reasons drug companies are feeling threatened. In the last several years, some best-selling medicines, like <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/lipitor_drug/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"

                                        In 2012, that led to $29 billion in savings for patients, said Mr. Aitken of IMS, or $29 billion in lost revenues for drug makers. Eighty-four percent of prescriptions dispensed last year were for generic medications.

                                        While drug companies generally remain highly profitable, recent trends have meant tough times for some companies, including Merck, whose profits crashed 50 percent this year primarily because the patent expired on its best-selling asthma pill, Singulair.

                                        So AstraZeneca has recently spent millions of dollars in court pursuing several small drug companies for patent infringement after they announced a plan to make a true cheap generic version of Pulmicort Respules. Though a New Jersey judge sided with the
                                        generic manufacturers this spring, legal appeals by AstraZeneca will keep the generics off the market for the near future. </p>

                                        As insurance policies require patients to contribute more out of pocket for medicines, public pressure to curb prices has grown. This year, more than 100 top cancer specialists protested the rising prices of cancer treatments. </p>

                                        Drug companies have long argued that pharmaceutical pricing reflects the cost of developing and testing innovative new drugs, many of which do not pan out or make it to market. </p>

                                        Critics counter that drug companies spend far more on marketing and sales than the 15 percent and 20 percent of their revenues that they devote to research and development. </p>

                                        Also, the focus of much pharmaceutical research in recent years has shifted from simple drugs for common diseases that would have widespread use to complicated molecules that would most likely benefit fewer patients but carry far higher price tags, in
                                        the realm of tens of thousands of dollars. </p>

                                        The newest offering for asthma is Novartis&#x2019;s Xolair, which is given by injection in a doctor&#x2019;s office every two weeks at a cost of up to $1,500, depending on the dose. Because the drug is so expensive and was deemed to have little or no
                                        benefit over inhalers for a vast majority of patients, the British government last year announced that it would not make it available through the National Health Service. It relented this year, agreeing to stock
                                        it for limited use, after the manufacturer offered a confidential discount. </p>

                                        In all other developed countries, governments similarly use a variety of tools to make sure that drug manufacturers sell their products at affordable prices. In Germany, regulators set drug wholesale and retail prices. Across Europe, national health authorities
                                        refuse to pay more than their neighbors for any drug. In Japan, the price of a drug must go down every two years. </p>

                                        Drug prices in the United States are instead set in hundreds of negotiations by hospitals, insurers and pharmacies with drug manufacturers, with deals often brokered by powerful middlemen called group purchasing organizations and pharmacy benefit managers,
                                        who leverage their huge size to demand discounts. The process can get nasty; if mediators offer too little for a given product, manufacturers may decide not to produce it or permanently drop out of the market, reducing
                                        competition. </p>

                                        With such jockeying determining supply, products can simply disappear and prices for vital medicines can fluctuate far more than they do for a carton of milk. After the price of Abby Hayes&#x2019;s Rhinocort Aqua nasal spray rose abruptly, it was unavailable
                                        for many months. That sent her family scrambling to find other prescription sprays, each with a price tag over $150. </p>

                                        This year the price of Advair dropped 10 percent in France, but in pharmacies in the Bronx, it has doubled in the last two years. </p>

                                        Twenty years ago, drugs that could safely be sold directly to patients typically moved off the prescription model as their patent life ended. That brought valuable medicines like nondrowsy antihistamines and acid reducers to drugstore shelves. But with
                                        profitable prescription products now selling for $100 per tiny bottle, there is little incentive to make the switch, since over-the-counter drugs rarely succeed if they cost more than $20. </p>
