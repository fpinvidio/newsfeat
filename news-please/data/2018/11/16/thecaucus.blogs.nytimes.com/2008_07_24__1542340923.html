		<div class="entry-content"><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">BERLIN — When one thinks of beer and bratwurst, one tends to think of either faraway Germany &#8212; or Milwaukee in the heartland. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That quirk of culinary geography says a lot about why Barack Obama can give a public speech in Berlin without catching the kind of flak that a similar outing under the Eiffel Tower would garner.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As the Obama campaign searched for a location here for his public address before a crowd that is expected to reach at least into the tens of thousands, a great deal of attention was paid to the backdrop within the city. Little was paid to the choice of country itself.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yet Germany is an easy call for a number of reasons. It is the site of two of America’s most cherished victories, over the Nazi regime in World War II and the Soviets in the Cold War. And for the Obama campaign, comparisons to President Kennedy are always welcome as long as they do not appear too overtly sought after. Do not expect to hear Mr. Obama claim, auf deutsch, that he is a Berliner.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But a broader combination of social, historical and even demographic factors make Germany a hit for American politicians going abroad, whether it be Mr. Obama or President Bush, who in 2006 enjoyed a hearty meal of barbecued pig on a spit with Chancellor Angela Merkel. <span id="more-5713"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Campaigning abroad means delving into American perceptions and stereotypes about foreign countries, even among allies. No political operative could forget the way French became pejorative shorthand for elitism against John Kerry in the 2004 campaign.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">One might think that the French would have a leg up in the public-relations game, thanks to Lafayette and de Tocqueville. Yet an appearance in Germany brings few of the dangers that a campaign speech before cheering throngs in the land of pinot and foie gras might. While plenty could go wrong, and a backlash is still possible, one thing is clear: There is little danger of being labeled effete in the home of Oktoberfest and oom-pah bands. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Germany can be, well, pretty American sometimes. And often overlooked is just how German the United States really is. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As the American ambassador noted when opening the new embassy to Germany on the Fourth of July, in the 2000 census the number of Americans reporting German ancestry was nearly 43 million, the highest tally of any group. That’s more than Irish or English or Italian, some five times the number claiming French roots and roughly the same number as African-American and Mexican combined.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The same debates that take place today over Latino immigrants and the Spanish language once centered around the German communities, which had their own newspapers, schools and theaters. At the peak of German migration to the United States 1.8 million came between 1880 and 1893, according to Klaus Bade, a professor at the University of Osnabrück and founder of the Institute for Migration Research and Intercultural Studies. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">To put that in perspective, that came at a time when the population of the United States was only around 50 million, or one-sixth of what it is today. That enormous influx left a lasting influence on American culture. It was &#8212; and still is &#8212; particularly powerful in the heartland. The Census Bureau said that every state in the Midwest reports Germany as the largest share of ancestry, with 44 percent in North Dakota and 43 percent in Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The identification with German ancestry in America receded in the 20th century for a couple of reasons. First, according to Professor Bade, the wave of immigrants came to an unusually abrupt halt as Germany went from having too few jobs to too many. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The other reason is a little more obvious: Germany’s place as America’s enemy in two consecutive world wars.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yet the significant American role in rebuilding and defending West Germany after the war led to what in some ways amounted to the largest exchange program in history, even if the leading edge was soldiers instead of students. That meant new contacts and even more chances for cross-pollination.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“There are an enormous number of organic connections between Germans and Americans,” said Jackson Janes, executive director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies in Washington, an independent think tank. He said that between 14 million and 16 million Americans were stationed in Germany since the 1940s, especially military families and their dependents. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The transformation of Germany from violent dictatorship to peaceful democracy stands as one of the great accomplishments in American history, a significant point of pride for the country. That may be why, even at the nadir of relations, Germany never caught the same degree of criticism as France for opposing the Iraq invasion. Though former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder was against the war in Iraq, it was cheese-eating surrender monkeys, not schnitzel-eating surrender monkeys. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Senator Obama may not say, “Ich bin ein Berliner,” this summer, but he need have no fear diving into a few frankfurters or hamburgers at an American picnic. The meat and potato Germans, their cuisine, and a lot of their culture, is as American as apple struedel, er, pie.</p>

			<p>I certainly hope that Obama at least says &#8220;Ich bin Berliner&#8221;. The classic &#8220;Ich bin EIN Berliner&#8221; raises howls of laughter from my German-speaking family, as JFK then proudly announced to the world that &#8220;I am a jelly filled donut&#8221;.</p>

			<p>As I read the section that says:</p>
<p>&#8220;The same debates that take place today over Latino immigrants and the Spanish language once centered around the German communities, which had their own newspapers, schools and theaters.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder, did the Republicans of that era use the same despicable tactics of fear-mongering and alien-bashing as they have in the last few years&#8211;darkly warning then that America was being overrun by Huns and Krauts&#8211;for no other reason than partisan political advantage?</p>
<p>Of the long list of Republican misdeeds in the last decade, I really think how the modern day version of the No-Nothing nativists in the GOP have demonized Latinos&#8211;while their business supporters profit from those Latinos laboring in the shadows, underpaid and unprotected, ranks high on the list of their most shameful acts.</p>
<p>For a nation built by immigrants&#8211;both willing and unwilling&#8211;to treat each new wave as if it is trash washed up on our pristine beaches&#8211;the Latinos today, the Germans, the Irish, the Chinese and the Italians before them&#8211;is simply beyond belief.</p>
<p>The notion that this nation is full up is without foundation in fact.</p>
<p>If you alloted 1,000 square feet of living space per person (that&#8217;s more than most people living in anything other than those obscene McMansions)&#8211;you could EVERY person on the planet into Texas.</p>

			<p>&#8220;And for the Obama campaign, comparisons to President Kennedy are always welcome as long as they do not appear too overtly sought after. Do not expect to hear Mr. Obama claim, auf deutsch, that he is a Berliner.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether it was raised before, but there was a real problem with Kennedy&#8217;s &#8220;expression of<br />
solidarity&#8221; with the German people (as it&#8217;saadvertised by Obama spin doctors), namely  &#8230; the nature of the German people in 1961.</p>

			<p>Actually, what JFK said was that he was a Jelly Doughnut. A native German speaker would have said &#8220;Ich bin Berliner&#8221;. Adding the &#8220;ein&#8221; changes the connotation. Just as we would say &#8220;I am sick&#8221; but to say &#8220;I am a sick person&#8221; changes the meaning.<br />
JFK penciled in the line on his way to Berlin, so it was not vetted. All proving that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.</p>

			<p>An odd distance from facts in this one: the Soviets occupied Berlin, so it wasn&#8217;t a &#8220;cherished US victory.&#8221;  Oompah and Oktoberfest are Munich and Bavaria, not Berlin and Prussia (it&#8217;s like a German going to Brooklyn for that real Cajun food).  Germany didn&#8217;t come in for as much criticism as France becasue below Schroeder, the Germans were helping out.  In any case, Obama probably picked Berlin because its the hot city of Europe these days and he might get that old JFK mojo on his side.</p>

			<p>Thanks for the interesting commentary. Having lived in both France and Germany (and a lover of both), I always found it interesting how differently the two countries were treated in the conservative media. I&#8217;ve always felt that the root of the cause the lack of French immigrants to the US. It seems that during the 19th century, almost every other European nation sent us their poor, their tired&#8230; Instead, France (being the largest nation in Western Europe, geographically-speaking) didn&#8217;t appear to need to suffer a mass emigration of citizens. There was plenty of labor and plenty of fertile farmland.</p>
<p>Although I love France and have spent more time there, I was often aware of my &#8220;foreigness&#8221; there. The moment I stepped on German soil, I was amazed by the immediate recognition of similarities between German and American cultures [perhaps more so than we share with the dreaded English &#8211; despite sharing (sort of) a language].</p>
<p>Imagine how ridiculous it would have sounded to boycott German beer alongside French wine.</p>

			<p>I fully agree with &#8220;Austrian&#8221;. But it seems like whole article is purely based on the American perception of Germans and to a lesser extent on reality. The Oktoberfest is only celebrated in one city, and therefore irrelevant to about 95 % of the German population.<br />
And regarding the American victory over the Soviets during the cold war. I might be mistaken, but didn&#8217;t East German protesters risking their lives during weekly demonstrations accomplish this victory, at least when it comes to the German part of the cold war? The wall didn&#8217;t vanish after Reagan&#8217;s speech; it was torn down by East Germans sick of the living conditions in their country!</p>

			<p>Hopefully Obama will gain some German values, like frugality, self-responsibility, innovativeness, an inclination towards manufacturing and creation. </p>
<p>Words are cheap in the German culture, actions are how you are judged. Looking upon the state to solve problems is antithetical to the Amercian German culture. This is probably why he is very unpopular in Pennsylvania, doesn&#8217;t have to do with people holding onto Guns and Religion.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s absolutely pathetic that we can turn our longest running alley into a slur (France) &#8211; and I come from the heart of that stupidity, North Carolina&#8230; home of Freedom Fries!!!!  Not sure we&#8217;ll ever live that one down.  I have a FREEDOM TICKLER, purchased at a highway gas station&#8230; to bizarre to pass up, on a picture frame at my desk to remind me of how stupid our world became for a while.</p>
<p>Why is it that people who&#8217;s roots are European are the most adamant in their hatred for Europe?  </p>
<p>How could such positive acceptance in Europe ever be seen as anything but positive for the US?  </p>
<p>The one sin of theirs was to disagree with us on the Iraqi invasion, and they turned out to be absolutely correct on that point.  The US seemed to be in a teen-age rebellion against the older (and most def. wiser) continent.  &#8220;You just don&#8217;t understand!  I hate you!&#8221;  Can you hear the door slamming to our bedroom door?  (We also seem to run up our credit cards and show the deficit of long-term thinking like an adolescents&#8230; but that&#8217;s getting off track.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m absolutely thrilled at Obama&#8217;s reception overseas, and the apex to that is his European reception.  I know I&#8217;m a hippie lost in time, but can&#8217;t we all be friends?!?!  Yes we can.  (For all those anti-social neo-cons&#8230; you&#8217;ll just have to learn to play nice or go sit in the corner in time out.)</p>

			<p>Please, show respect to other languages. In paragrasph #4 it should be auf Deutsch and not &#8220;auf deutsch.&#8221;  To readers unfamiliar with written German: the upper case is used for all German  nouns. Hence once you begin a phrase in German you must follow the rules.  Especially the one that means German language, &#8220;Deutsch.&#8221;  It is okay to write about streudel in lower case. In German it is Streudel. Pie, by the way is Torte und nicht Streudel!</p>

			<p>Predictably, the NYT tries to justify today&#8217;s immigration rates by looking at the past.  Comparing German immigration to today&#8217;s immigration is apples to oranges.  We were an expanding, immature nation in the 19th century, and needed more people.  Today, with rising income inequality and wage stagnation, it should be clear that we do not need vast numbers of additional poor people.  Earlier immigration was in waves, but the current flood of people we&#8217;re under has no end in sight.  And yes Germans had their own schools, but over time they assimilated and learned English.  Today we bend over backwards to accomodate other languages.  It amazes me that English is the new lingua franca, yet we do little to protect its primacy (because it&#8217;s obviously racist to expect immigrants to adapt).</p>
