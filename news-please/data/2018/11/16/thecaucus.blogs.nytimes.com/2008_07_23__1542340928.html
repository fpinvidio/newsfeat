		<div class="entry-content"><div class="standard190 right"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/promos/politics/blog/p24convention.190.gif" alt="Denver Group Ad"/><span class="caption">Part of an advertisement placed in Wednesday&#8217;s Chicago Tribune by the Denver Group.</span></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>CORRECTED |</strong> As many have been saying all along, Senator Barack Obama is only the presumed Democratic nominee. And that fact has given heart to some of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s supporters, who are investing tens of thousands of dollars to pressure the party to put her name to a binding vote at the convention next month.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Denver Group, founded by two political novices who have been frustrated with the treatment of Mrs. Clinton since February, ran full-page ads on Wednesday and two weeks ago in The Chicago Tribune and Congressional Quarterly calling for Mrs. Clinton to be placed “in nomination” in Denver. They contend that because neither candidate has enough elected delegates to claim the nomination, Democratic Party rules call for a process to begin that could result in her name being presented for possible nomination at the convention. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/promos/politics/blog/denvergroup_ad1.pdf">Wednesday’s ad</a> cited Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who won the nomination on the fourth round of balloting. (<a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/promos/politics/blog/denvergroup_ad2.pdf">Here</a> is their earlier ad.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Contentious politics is not losing politics,” said Marc Rubin, a television and movie writer. He and the co-founder of the Denver Group, Heidi Li Feldman of the Georgetown Law Center, say that a perceived forced unity imposed by party leadership is likely to alienate Clinton supporters and ultimately cost the eventual nominee the election. <span id="more-5715"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Howard Dean, the Democratic Party chairman, has said Mrs. Clinton will be “on the ballot” at the convention.The group is urging him to allow the process that could bring her nomination up for a vote to go forward.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Calls to the Democratic National Committee were referred to the Obama campaign, and Bill Burton, a spokesman said: “We’re working out the details of the convention, and we’ll let people know when the specifics are worked out.” </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But for the Denver Group, there is nothing to “work out.”    </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a <a href="//heidilipotpourri.blogspot.com/2008/07/why-being-on-ballot-is-not-enough.html">post</a> on her personal blog, Professor Feldman compares &#8220;being on the ballot&#8221; to throwing the ceremonial first pitch at a baseball game, while being placed in nomination is akin to being added to the team roster. The group is considering running advertisements to explain the distinction.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What is clear is that some of Mrs. Clinton’s supporters are not ready to give up the fight. The Denver Group, established in late June, has already collected approximately $30,000, and hopes to at least double that and buy time on CNN. Its success reflects a lingering sense among some Democrats that party leaders are trying to block Mrs. Clinton from the nomination. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I don’t know which way it’ll go and neither does he,” said Professor Feldman of Mr. Dean. “If he knew, he would just allow it to happen.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Rubin admits that a Clinton victory in convention balloting would be a long shot &#8212; at least 175 superdelegates would have to reverse their public positions, should her name be placed in nomination and the matter be put to a vote &#8212; but “the potential is there.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">CORRECTION | An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Professor Feldman believes that Democratic Party rules require Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s nomination be put to a binding vote. In fact, according to Professor Feldman, the rules only require that a process be started that could result in a nominating vote. </p>

			<p>Some day, Clinton is going to want something and need party support to get it- maybe a bill passed, perhaps even a seat on the Supreme Court&#8211; and too late, she and her supporters will realize the meaning of cutting off one&#8217;s nose to spite one&#8217;s face. Keep it up, Clintonistas. Some day you will live to regret your pathetic, pointless pettiness.</p>

			<p>I fully support the Denver Group. Barack Obama does not have enough delegates to claim the nomination. Considering the overt sexism the DNC and the media hurled at HRC, she still managed to garner about 18 million votes. I will never unite with the Democratic party after the way the primary season was run. Dean and Pelosi were trying to force HRC out as early as February. The Democratic party can no longer complain when the Republicans do not want to count votes, given Michigan and Florida. HRC should not relent. If it has to come to a fight for the nomination at the convention floor, so be it. The Democratic party thinks it can take women for granted, that women have no other choices. Sorry, but I know I do. I do not need the Democratic party, nor am I giving any money to the DNC. I am taking my vote to the Republicans&#8211;upscale, educated and not worried about reproductive rights. Younger women can worry about it. After all, they think women of HRC&#8217;s age and older did not fight for them. Younger women do not even have a sense of recent history. I would rather vote for McCain than Obama, which is my intentions as long as HRC is not the Democratic nominee. McCain speaks to me on taxes, which is an excellent reason to vote for him. During this primary season, sexism was accepted by men and women. HRC was a calculating and ambitious politician, and so it went over and over again. When was a male running for the presidency or any other political office not calculating and ambitious? Those traits are fine in a man and unacceptable in a women. That is sexism. Racism is out of the question. Talk about a double standard. I am professional women who will never vote for Obama. Women who found fault with HRC for anything and everything participated in keeping sexism alive and well. HRC is not perfect. No male who entered the Democratic or Republican fields was or is perfect either. McCain and Obama have plenty of flaws.</p>

			<p>One more” tack? This fight will go past Denver for the true Clinton die-hards. And among them might just be counted Bill. After all, he still has yet to campaign for Obama. </p>
<p>— Posted by matt (#4)</p>
<p>As a Hillary Clinton diehard supporter, it better go past Denver. Hillary should not even help Barack Obama after portraying her as a racist during the SC primary. He used race from the beginning of the campaign to the end. Hillary said that it took a president to realize MLK&#8217;s dream. It certainly did. King could not sign any legislation. He was not elected to any office. LBJ signed the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. Suddenly, Hillary and Bill were bona fide racists. The media ran away with a non-story. What HRC said was the truth. It is sad day when someone cannot speak the truth. I do like the idea of Hillary helping Barack. He does not deserve the help of the woman he and his campaigned maligned as a racist from start to finish. Bill does not have to do anything for Barack. Hillary and Bill do not owe him a thing. Barack owes Hillary Clinton. </p>
<p>A Hillary Clinton Diehard.</p>

			<p>Jean Simmons is pathetic.  She is totally devoted to a cult of personality and not to the overwhelming issues at stake in this election.  She is one with the forces that elected George Bush.  Let her vote for McCain. I will donate another $100 dollars to the Obama cause, as a simple expression of my determination not to let the petty forces of narrow sexism and racism dominate this election.</p>

<p>Senator Clinton&#8217;s debts are covered.  She may not get her own money back, but she always considered that a contribution to the cause. The PUMA pac did a contribution drive, and it worked. They should be commended for this.</p>
<p>The Denver Group is only looking to ensure a female candidate gets equal treatment to any male candidate under the written rules of the party.  Questioning this will only serve to reinforce the sexist reality seen throughout the primary campaign. </p>
<p>If your candidate has a problem with following the rules now, a lot of people are going to be questioning why the rules only apply when it benefits him. </p>
<p>If Obama wants to win this election, it&#8217;s incumbent on him to work to unify the party. The voters are out there, but he hasn&#8217;t earned their votes.  He talks about listening on his foreign trip, yet he does no such thing back at home.  The people of Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan,  Israel, Germany, France and the UK aren&#8217;t going to be voting for him.  He is not the President.</p>

			<p>The Denver group is democracy in action. There is no valid reason that people who want Clinton as the nominee cannot form a group to try and achieve that goal. It is free speech in action and citizens getting involved in the process. </p>
<p>I am certain that Obama will be the Democratic nominee. I am voting for divided government. I do not trust either party to control the government.</p>

			<p>The Clinton machine used subtler tactics in 2000 and 2004 to undermine the candidacies of Gore and Kerry so that a place could be &#8220;held&#8221; for Hillary in 2008 (if a Democrat had won in either year, the Clintons&#8217; dream of a second act would have been kaput). Of course, they were less desperate in 2000 and 2004, so they could afford to be more subtle. </p>
<p>Now, however, Obama has thrown them off their game; they seem to have decided their last best hope is 2012, and to hell with subtlety. Hillary knows she will not &#8220;win&#8221; if her name is placed in nomination in Denver next month, but she also knows this tactic (like the others emanating from her camp through various surrogates) will almost certainly ensure an Obama loss in November.</p>
<p>She is obviously more than willing to allow the odious John McCain to hold her place for the next four years, if that&#8217;s what it takes. After all, by 2012 God Himself could not win if He ran as a Republican, and you can bet the mortgage that, at the end of the 2012 primaries, Hillary will be the only Democrat left standing. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s all creepily impressive in its narcissism and brutality, and really terribly sad.</p>

			<p>Gretchin : 18 million democrats have not yet begun to fight. Everyday we see Obama with his arrogance of a presuming that he is there already. There will be a fight on the floor There will be presidential candidate.It will be Hillary.Too much Obama by the media is eating awy at his popularity but he is too narcistic to realize it.</p>

			<p>There has always been a vote at the convention. I don&#8217;t know why Obama is trying to become a dictator so soon.  First Obama and his staff have declared obama is already president (Hurry someone tell Bush that he&#8217;s not president anymore.) Then he declares that he will be president for 10 years.  So why he is afraid of a little vote at the convention?  He is  already president so there is nothing for him to be afraid of. Is there?</p>

			<p>$30,000 is chickenfeed in national politics &#8212; for both Obama and Clinton. Barack can (and does) raise that amount of money in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Clinton is not going to be the nominee, and it is preposterous to suggest that putting her name up for a vote will foster &#8220;party unity.&#8221; It&#8217;s just another attempt to ratchet back up those  resentments which have fading fast for the past couple of months.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t think two cranks who don&#8217;t know when to quit, with their measly $30K, deserve this much attention.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Calls to the Democratic National Committee were referred to the Obama campaign&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>This sentence speaks volumes, and is why many of us have been outraged by the DNC for the last seven months.  The DNC is currently not the DNC, and has not been for months.  It is the ONC, the Obama National Committee.  We, the voters, are outraged because the Democratic primary was a travesty with unfair caucuses and temporary rules that subverted the entire mission of the primary (FL and MI fiasco), causing millions of votes/voters to be disenfranchised.  There should have been a revote.  The DNC failed to accomplish the important mission of running a fair primary.  We might as well not have had it at all.</p>
<p>It is not a matter of &#8220;getting over it.&#8221;  The more experienced and capable candidate was knocked off the ticket during a time when our nation is a sinking ship, and this happened because a few elites at the top of the DNC and media push-overs decided for millions of American who should be president.   We are now left with a stuffed shirt, the least qualified and experienced candidate in our nation&#8217;s history, who says what he needs to say to get elected and who has a background chock full of sleazy politicians and sleazy actions, and who accomplished nothing for his constituency.  </p>
<p>Bravo Denver Group.  Will contribute.</p>
