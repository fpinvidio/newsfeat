		<div class="entry-content"><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Senator Barack Obama arrived in Germany earlier today in advance of a highly anticipated speech he’ll deliver in Berlin. But the presumptive Democratic nominee already moved to lower expectations about just how large of a crowd will gather to hear him: “I doubt we’re going to have a million screaming Germans,” Mr. Obama said on his campaign plane, <a href="//thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/obama-plays-down-berlin-speech/">according to a dispatch</a> from The Times’s Jeff Zeleny.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Also on Mr. Obama’s agenda today – an afternoon nap – if he can fit it in.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Our Berlin bureau chief, Nicholas Kulish, <a href="//thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/as-german-as-america/">previews</a> Mr. Obama’s speech in the German capital today, noting that for cultural reasons he “can give a public speech in Berlin without catching the kind of flak that a similar outing under the Eiffel Tower would garner.”<br />
<span id="more-5719"></span><br />
Mr. Obama <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/us/politics/24obama.html?ref=politics">met with officials</a> of the Israeli and Palestinian governments yesterday, and before flying to Germany, made a pre-dawn visit to <a href="//thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/obama-visits-the-wall/">Jersusalem’s Western Wall</a>, a holy site.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Washington Post notes that the <a href="//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/23/AR2008072303276.html">careful planning</a> that went into Mr. Obama’s trip to Israel underscores the importance his campaign is placing on courting Jewish voters:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">
For all the hype about his trip to Iraq and his speech in Berlin, it was the Israel leg that was the most sensitive and the most meticulously planned, according to sources involved with the arrangements. That fact alone is a testament to the presidential candidate&#8217;s ongoing concerns about the Jewish vote this November, and the extraordinary lengths to which the senator from Illinois is going to ensure support from that traditional Democratic constituency.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Obama&#8217;s position on Israel has been fairly mainstream. He has declared himself an undying ally of the Jewish state and has indicated that he would like the United States to return to a position of honest broker in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. But his connection to his former pastor Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., whose anti-Israel sermons were widely reported this past spring, caused concern among some Jewish groups.</p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Obama travels to Paris and London over the next few days. In a dig at the Illinois senator, the Republican National Committee announced today that it was going on the air with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTCwKYQOGHs">a radio ad</a> reminding voters “in Paris, MO; Paris, MI; and Paris, ME, that Obama’s politically expedient record has consistently put politics before the needs of our military.” And the McCain campaign is running a new Web ad linking Mr. Obama to Fidel Castro.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And across an ocean, a debate raged on Wednesday between Mr. Obama and his Republican rival, Senator John McCain, over the historical chronology of the buildup of troops in Iraq. The Times’s Michael Cooper <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/us/politics/24check.html?ref=politics">fact checks the statements of both candidates.</a></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. McCain campaigns <a href="//www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-07-23-armstrong-mccain_N.htm">in Ohio today</a> where he will appear with cyclist and fellow cancer survivor Lance Armstrong at the Livestrong Summit</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">USA Today’s David Jackson reports on <a href="//www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-07-23-wilkesbarre_N.htm">the town hall meeting</a> Mr. McCain held on Wednesday in Wilkes-Barre, Penn. The presumptive Republican nominee had to <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/us/politics/24mccain.html?ref=politics">cancel plans</a> to visit Louisiana today to tout his support for oil exploration due to Hurricane Dolly.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Times’s Jennifer Steinhauer looks at the <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/us/politics/24arizona.html?ref=politics">difficulties Senator McCain might face</a> in his home state of Arizona in the general election, noting that victory there is not a sure thing. A few factors to keep in mind:</p>
<blockquote><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">
The number of independent voters in Arizona has risen 12 percent since 2004, and those voters have helped send a Democrat to the governor’s mansion and given the party four of the state’s eight Congressional seats — including two in 2006, one in a historically Republican district.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At the same time, Arizona Democrats, like many of their counterparts around the country, have outpaced Republicans in voter registration, adding almost 20,000 voters to the rolls since March, compared with the Republican majority’s 8,600 new voters. The second-term Democratic governor, Janet Napolitano, remains wildly popular.</p></blockquote>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>The E-Campaign: </strong>The Boston Globe’s Lisa Wangsness looks at the McCain campaign’s <a href="//www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/07/24/for_mccain_net_deficit_with_young/">efforts on the Internet</a> and finds room for improvement: “McCain&#8217;s campaign, lagging far behind Obama among young voters, is trying to catch up. It will soon roll out new MySpace-style social networking features on its website &#8211; which at the moment has special sections for women, veterans, and even lawyers, but not young people. It is also increasing its youth grass-roots organizing across the country and honing a new message aimed at young voters &#8211; &#8220;service to a cause greater than your own self-interest&#8221; &#8211; designed to dovetail with the 71-year-old&#8217;s biography.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Politico’s Jonathan Martin <a href="//www.politico.com/news/stories/0708/12008.html">compares liberal and conservative opinion leaders</a> on the Internet and notes that “the right is engaged in the business of opining while the left features sites that offer a more reportorial model.” He continues: “At first glance, these divergent approaches might not seem consequential. But as the 2008 campaign progresses, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the absence of any websites on the right devoted to reporting—as opposed to just commenting on the news—is proving politically costly to Republicans.”</p>

			<p>america has lost its moral compass these past eight years. now, we have a chance to regain the high ground.</p>
<p>the rest of the world is excited at the possibility of an obama presidency&#8230;with good reason&#8230;and there is nothing wrong with that. nothing</p>
<p>all the repug haters are nit-picking, but the obama tide will sweep them aside. </p>
<p>god bless america.</p>

			<p>Radio ads like the one cited here disappoint and anger me.  I dislike spots in which one person in the total villain (Obama &#8211; Boo!) and the other one the White Knight (McCain &#8211; Yaay!)</p>
<p>This is the McCain who:<br />
&#8211; did not support the last Veteran&#8217;s Bill;<br />
&#8211; did not even bother to show up to vote on the FISA Bill;<br />
&#8211; attended none of six hearing held on Afghanistan by the Senate Armed Services Committee (on which he is the senior Republican member);<br />
&#8211; has a worse voting attendance record than Obama during the time they have both been in the Senate (2005-present);<br />
&#8211; voted for the war in Iraq.</p>

			<p>His very welcome here and very popular comparing to McCain.Most European people hope Obama will be the next president.Tonight&#8217;s speech will be broadcast live on German TV.Funny that Fox News channel claims that the venue is an old Hitler&#8217;s relic which in fact is the monument commemorating the Victory over Hitler.</p>

			<p>McCain said he would run an upbeat, positive campaign.  When?  Although I can see where some Americans might be drawn to his policies, the campaign he has run disqualifies him from being the American president.  The fact that people would vote for someone who accuses an American senator of being a traitor shows how low this country has sunk.</p>

			<p>Today&#8217;s caption in Der Spiegel reads&#8230;&#8221;The superstar has landed.&#8221; Americans as well as Europeans are clearly in love with Barack. I&#8217;m excited to travel. I&#8217;m 27. I have been traveling abroad since I was 20. 7 years of apologizing to people and explaining that we&#8217;re not all ignorant has been exhausting. I genuinely want to thank Barack for making it less difficult for those of us who enjoy socializing with others around the globe. Improving international relations with a &#8220;bella figura&#8221; is just as important to me as immigration, economy, and the war.</p>

			<p>SO McCain is running an ad linking Obama to Castro?? Great, here comes another 4 months of same-old smear tactics that serve to polarize this Nation.</p>
<p>What we need is clear, level-headed campaigning, followed up by clear, leavel-headed policymaking. </p>
<p>What we need is a Moderate.</p>
<p>America&#8217;s greatest Presidents have been moderates, Centrists in the best sense of the word, uniting the country, bringing us forward, not just left or right. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t believe me??? Check out this great new book, Leading From the Center: Why Moderates make the Best Presidents, by Gil Troy (www.leadingfromthecenter.com)</p>
<p>It will illuminate you as to America&#8217;s greatest moderate presidents, from Lincoln to Reagan.</p>
<p>Hopefully 2008 brings us another, whether an Obama or a McCain. But if this new ad is any indication, I&#8217;m not so sure it&#8217;ll happen.</p>

			<p>Today, when American travel outside of their homeland, they become subject to hate profiling by many countries in the world as they don&#8217;t see American as friendly rather they see us as arrogant, threatening and ignorant. This is one strong reason to elect smart, intelligent and charismatic leader to lead us and restore our pride and image abroad. Doing town-hall meetings every week is not going to cut it.</p>

			<p>a comment to the last paragraph: I&#8217;ve never seen the Republicans in such a constant of reacting&#8230; they&#8217;re trying to spin/discuss the news rather than making the news.  I don&#8217;t want to get over-confident in this election, but I&#8217;ve never seen such amazingly weak performances from the Republican machine.  And it&#8217;s not just a bad week &#8211; this has been going over for the better part of 4 months.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually starting to feel sorry for them&#8230; but the Republicans don&#8217;t seem to matter much for us Democrats this time around, either.  We have a candidate that we are voting for&#8230; excited to support rather than simply voting against someone.  </p>
<p>This is shaping up to be a very relaxing/enjoyable November.</p>

			<p>To recap, so far the McCain camp has dismissed the Obama trip as too late, the candidate himself too inexperienced, too presumptuous, and too Presidential. All the while his visits have been received warmly everywhere. I can hardly wait to hear what sour grapes whining the McCain handlers are going to come up with today.  I am looking forward to coverage of the McCain speech; any bets on what shade of green his face will be today?</p>

			<p>It is heart warming to watch the reception that<br />
Sen.Obama is receiving.</p>
<p>Sen.McCain&#8217;s campaign is in shatters&#8230;. just like the<br />
picture of him in front of the Cheese Display in a<br />
grocery store.<br />
On his recent trip to Europe McCain barely got any support for his &#8220;fundraisers&#8221;.</p>
<p>It should be clear that everyone wants change from<br />
the old to the new.</p>

			<p>Politico’s Jonathan Martin compares liberal and conservative opinion leaders on the Internet and notes that “the right is engaged in the business of opining while the left features sites that offer a more reportorial model.”<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
Ha, why am I not surprised? The right complains about the &#8220;liberal media monster,&#8221; but in fact media outlets on the right are a sham.  I mean, am I understanding this correctly?  &#8220;Liberal&#8221; opinion websites are spending more time reporting the news, while &#8220;conservative&#8221; sites are spending their time whining?  HA!</p>
<p>Maybe I should refine that.  Obama is doing something, hence the &#8220;liberal media&#8221; has something to report on.  No one is taking McCain seriously anymore, hence they&#8217;re spending their time tearing down Obama.  </p>
<p>What people are missing:  it&#8217;s the McCain camp who is completely obsessed with Obama.  Why not spend time defining or defending your own policies, John?  Oh yeah that&#8217;s right, Obama&#8217;s name gets more press so your entire strategy is to foul it up as much as possible.  Meanwhile, no one knows what you stand for or believe.  Great job. </p>
<p>Word to the naive:  most of the ruckus over Obama is coming from the Republican camp. If the media really is creating a circus around Obama, the right-wing opinionators are the clowns riding around on their unicycles. Watch Fox News. How much are they covering Obama&#8217;s trip? If you said obsessively, you&#8217;re correct.</p>
<p>Final word to the McCain camp:  say/do something substantial to actually earn our attention.  It&#8217;s not Obama&#8217;s fault you&#8217;re old hat.</p>

			<p>Bracak Obama now has a chance to convince European leaders that he is the real deal and that he wants the United States work as a partner with Europe. Europe, like the reset of the world, perceive the United States in a bad light. Brack Obama brings forth a refreshing change to the policies of the past eight years.</p>
<p>As for the Republican and McCain campaign&#8217;s, they are touting the same platform and policies of the current administration. On NBC Nightly News last night on 19% of those polled in the latest NBC NEws- Wall Street poll say the the country is heading in the right direction; the lowest poll numbers in history. While those poll think they trust McCain more and believe he has more experience; that gap is narrowing. Finally, Barack Obama has a 47% &#8211; 42% lead over John McCain; unchanged from the last poll in June. This poll was conducted before Barack Obama&#8217;s trip and before John McCain&#8217;s missteps this week.</p>

			<p>GM &amp; Curliquedan</p>
<p>I apologize to GM. And, yes Curliquedan it is true that I am very angry about the Iraq war. Nor, I do not like the fact that Israel does not trust Obama just because he wants to negotiate with Iran to prevent another war?<br />
Is Israel now going to dictate how we run our diplomacy?  Not sure, why I take it so personally but I guess I feel for the young American soldiers fighting for &#8216;democracy&#8217; all over the world without almost any support from other nations. </p>
<p>During my travels abroad I have met with anti-American sentiments just too many times and could never understand why? After all, it was America who helped to rebuild 1/2 the world after the WWII.  </p>
<p>And, I cannot stand McCain for constantly attacking Obama for being anti-patriotic or saying Obama does not support our soldiers. </p>
<p>This week McCain was said that Obama would rather loose the war in Iraq in order to win the presidential campaign. That’s, I think, is as low as McCain can get.</p>

<p>I would think that Obama is lobbying for more support in Afghanistan and Iran regardless who the president may be. Is that &#8216;wrong for America?&#8217;</p>
<p>As I said earlier, Chancellor Merkel said this morning that she will NOT support sending more German soldiers to Afghanistan. Who is going to help us?</p>

me!&#8221; when you were wronged.  You were probably too busy to say this while hiding your U.S. passport.<br />

			<p>Curliquedan, is that the best you can come up with? How sad. You might be taken seriously if your criticisms weren&#8217;t so trite and predictable.</p>
<p>Had Obama said &#8220;If I am elected President&#8221; you no doubt would have had some snide observation about his lack of confidence in his own electability. Yawn. Sorry, your comments are so predictable that they put me to sleep.</p>
<p>As for the money he is &#8220;throwing away&#8221; on the trip, wasn&#8217;t it just last week that he was being chided for not having made a trip yet?   He can do nothing to satisfy you, which is why your remarks are so inconsequential. Yawn.</p>
<p>BTW did you see what McCain had to say about Obama&#8217;s trip?<br />
From The Washington Post: Interviewed on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Today&#8221; show on Monday morning, Obama&#8217;s Republican rival, Sen. John McCain, said he &#8220;was glad&#8221; Obama was meeting with Petraeus and hearing firsthand about the buildup of U.S. troops over the past year.</p>
<p>So tell us again about why he should not have gone at all.  There, at least I&#8217;m awake again. No, I&#8217;m not laughing with you- I&#8217;m laughing at you.</p>
<p>Oh yes, the money. It&#8217;s called a fact finding trip. Look it up. Those of us who are at least minimally tuned in to current events are aware that politicians who care to be informed do it often, even &#8211; gasp!&#8211; Republicans!  If he didn&#8217;t go, you would trash him for his ignorance, and since he did go, you trash him for wasting the money.  So dull. So lame. So&#8211; well, typical of you and your ilk.</p>
<p>Thanks for your concern, but it&#8217;s OK if he spends my money that way.  In fact, I&#8217;d better go log on and make another donation today. Thanks for the reminder.</p>

			<p>Between the costs of this junket and the $5 million that is to be spent on advertising during the Olympics, Senator Obama is throwing away an awful lot of money.<br />
— Posted by Curliquedan<br />
You call this a junket? I forgot what did you call it when McCain strolled thru the market place with troops and gunships guarding him? Obama is doing exactly what needs to be done!<br />
As far as how he spends the money he raised, thats none of your business. He is spending on exactly the right things, and is doing well!</p>
<p>it’s the height of fiscal irresponsibility…but of course it’s in keeping with the behavior of tax-and-spend Democrats.</p>
<p>Lastly, the tax and spend Democrats Curliquedan? What a laugh. Your man Bush has run up huge deficits, and for 6 years had not one veto of a spending bill by your Republican Congress. Your man McCain has promised to erase the deficit by 2012&#8230;er&#8230;2016&#8230;.er..2012. Which is it again? Oh and how will he do it? He wont. He will continue the massive tax cuts for the rich, and continuing the war. More of the irresponsible spending and waste. The man that knows nothing about the economy and will replicate Bushs policies, has Curlique Danny hoodwinked! Hook, line and sinker.<br />
Obama, right for America! Yea!</p>

			<p>Hey Gretch, Obama&#8217;s doing a lot of talking for a &#8220;fact-finding trip.&#8221; Aren&#8217;t you suppose to listen at least a little on those and not give news conferences after every meeting? Also, do you agree that it would have made sense to actually go on the so-called &#8220;fact-finding trip&#8221; before he gave his major policy speech on Iraq and Afghanistan? No need to respond, the answers are obvious even to the most partisan Obama cultists. </p>
<p>So typical that his supporters end up in ideological pretzels trying to defend this guy.</p>
