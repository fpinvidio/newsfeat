<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">BERLIN – Senator Barack Obama arrived <a href="//thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/as-german-as-america/">in Germany</a> on Thursday amid high anticipation for an evening speech he is poised to deliver here in the Tiergarten, the German capital&#8217;s equivalent of Central Park. As he held meetings with Chancellor Angela Merkel and other officials, he sought to tackle another task: lowering expectations.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I doubt we’re going to have a million screaming Germans &#8212; let’s tamp down expectations here,” Mr. Obama told reporters as he flew here from Tel Aviv, joking that he only recently learned that his audience was expected to be so large. “We’re sort of on the high-wire all of the sudden.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Obama, who is nearing the final days of his first international trip as a presidential candidate, has navigated a political high-wire for days as he traveled through Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan and Jerusalem. Germany, France and Britain remain on his agenda this week as he works to prove himself on a worldwide stage in a trip that has been heavily promoted by his campaign.<br />
<span id="more-5718"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I think the world is keenly interested in this election. I think they’re hungry for a sense of where America’s going,” Mr. Obama said, standing in the aisle of his campaign plane. “Certainly there’s a curiosity factor involved.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Obama met for about an hour with Chancellor Merkel at the Federal Chancellery before holding an afternoon session with Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Mr. Obama, who acknowledged on Thursday that he was lacking sleep from his weeklong trip, said he also hoped to take an afternoon break before delivering his evening speech.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Aides to the Obama campaign have suggested that the speech in Berlin was neither a campaign nor a political event. When a reporter asked the senator if he considered the address a campaign event, he said with a puzzled look: “As opposed to?”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“It’s not a political rally,” he added. “Hopefully, it will be viewed as a substantive, articulation of the relationship I’d like to see between the United States and Europe. I’m hoping to communicate across the Atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">While Mr. Obama may well be the first American presidential candidate to deliver a speech in Berlin, several presidents have made important addresses in the city, including John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Mr. Obama shrugged off any comparisions.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“They were presidents, I am a citizen,” Mr. Obama said. “But obviously Berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post World War II effort to bring the continent together and to bring the West together. Then, later to bring the East and the West together. So I think it’s a natural place to talk.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Even as supporters lined the streets in Berlin on Thursday, hoping to catch a glimpse of Mr. Obama, he conceded that a key piece of his audience is in the United States.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“There’s no doubt,” he said, “that part of what I want to communicate on both sides of the Atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together.”</p>

			<p>I increasingly find this man&#8217;s ego, and his manipulative tendencies, offputting, inappropriate and even frightening.  Every day of this trip has made me less certain that I want to vote for him.<br />
Sure, he&#8217;s smart and clever&#8230;but arrogance combined with inexperience often cancel out intelligence.  It&#8217;s been happening since the beginning of time.</p>

			<p>Regarding finding Obama offputting, inappropriate and frightening &#8211; I find it important for one of our candidates to realize the importance of the world and how America fits in.  We&#8217;ve had 8 years of &#8220;I&#8217;m going to Disneyworld&#8221;.</p>

			<p>#1 &#8211; undecided (hardly)</p>
<p>Given the demands and stresses of running for the Presidency, Senator Obama has presented an impeccable stature, grace and desire for harmony and progress in the world.</p>
<p>All McCain offers is more of the same Bush-like behavior: arrogant, coercive and wrong at the top of his voice.</p>
<p><b>Mr Bush never understood the difference between Leading the World, and Bullying the World.</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid the touchy and confused Mr McCain offers more of the same.</p>

			<p>Obama is no stranger than any of the other politicians in the USA.  He&#8217;s playing a game to win the election and more power to him.  He&#8217;ll be far worthier an occupant of the White House than W.  </p>
<p>Obama isn&#8217;t perfect, nor are his opponents.  I don&#8217;t see why he has to be held to some ridiculously high standard.  No one without a powerful ego could make it through the ridiculously long and intrusive US election process.  Wimps tend not to get elected.</p>

			<p>Just hours away from Mr. Obama addressing my fellow Berliners, let me say: There will be a massive crowd. Almost everybody I know is going. It&#8217;s not politics, neither it&#8217;s the person himself, I think it&#8217;s the trace of history hovering in the air that&#8217;s drawing people there tonight. He could be or say something historic and people don&#8217;t want to miss out on it.<br />
Interestingly, some Berliners even received a campaign ad in their regular mail on Tuesday inviting them to the event tonight. I asked friends and it seems only people living in rather wealthy quarters of Berlin and not in some of the notoriously critical and more politicized parts of the city received this ad. However, it feels strange being addressed by a politician I cannot even vote for.</p>

			<p>I wish Obama all the best today. I&#8217;d love to see America regain its regard in the world, and I hope Obama can help facilitate that.</p>
<p>The images from Obama&#8217;s international trip have been nothing short of outstanding, and Obama has exceeeded every expectation concerning his political skill. While I know the MSM is disappointed that&#8211;as of yet&#8211;Obama has not made any major gaffes, this young senator has proven that he&#8217;s smart, thoughtful, charismatic and able to lead the world. Already, world leaders and even President Bush are adopting Obama&#8217;s strategies concerning timelines in Iraq and shifting attention to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to Obama&#8217;s speech today. I hope the MSM will cover it in its entirety and in a fair and balanced way.</p>
<p>Obama makes me proud of my country, something I haven&#8217;t felt for the past eight years.</p>

			<p>undecideded voter@7:59- Did we just read the same article? Sometimes I think Americans have gotten so used to &#8220;dumb and dumber&#8221; they don&#8217;t realize how intelligent people with brains function. I am proud to see Sen. Obama on the world stage reflecting what is best about America. It will take some getting used, as the best of us hasn&#8217;t shown up on the world stage in about seven years.</p>

			<p>On the other hand, I find his straight-forwardness and new ideas, refreshing. He carries himself as though he were the leader of the free world and the world seems to have a new found liking for an American leader. All in all, I think that bodes well for America and the rest of the world. What I admire most about his world-wide trip is, he is sticking to his guns and he will make every effort to be out of the occupation of Iraq in 16 months. That is the best news, yet !!!<br />

			<p>Obama has been called naive, inexperienced, soft &#8230; This trip has nixed all of that. Obama is showng to the world what is best about America. No matter the circumstances of your birth, if you set goals and are willing to work hard to achieve them, anything and everything is possible. Despite racism, sexism, and a whole lot of other isms, if you continue to strive, you can achieve.<br />
Perhaps most importantly, he is showing to the world that Americans can honor and respect different cultures and customs; we are not a nation trying to go it alone.</p>

			<p>No#1.  I failed to find the trace of arrogance, manipulative tendencies and ego you are refering to in regards to this man. Perhaps you should sometines refrain from reading between the lines, and also, I suppose you will not vote for him for  reason(s) known only to you and secretly tucked within your heart anyway. I am just truly tired of bloggers like yourself using commentary forums like this one, to be unkind and nasty to others.<br />
It is your vote and you free to do as you wish with it.</p>

			<p>Critics of Mr. Obama accuse him of being inexperienced as a leader.  They call his positions naive.  They suggest his meetings with potential adversaries would display weakness and a tendency to concede, as if he were Neville Chamberlain meeting Hitler.  Instead, he has with mastery and strength seized the moment in the spotlight of the campaign to demonstrate thoughtful composure and eloquence.  America and the world have seen a degree of natural leadership they had almost forgotten.  Now his critics want to say that he is presumptious and arrogant.  How ridiculous!  The day President Bush claimed victory in the 2000 election the Stock Market began to slide downward.  Senator Obama presents himself to the world, acting as the president he will become, and in the same week, the market picks up as the price of oil begins to fall.  I realize that there is no real evidence to link that to Obama, but public confidence has a way of being reflected in the market.  Mr. Obama represents us all as who we are when we are at our best: respectfully willing to listen, and capable of articulating the solutions to our problems.</p>

			<p>Dear Undecided Voter,</p>
<p>Obviously you don&#8217;t mind the arrogant and ego-centric tendencies of our current president. What he lacks in brains he makes up for in ego &#8211; a cheap substitute for intelligence. A naturally brilliant man is always seen as an egotist by those that are threaten by his mental capacity &#8212; resulting in you take on Senator Obama&#8230;In this country stupidity always seems to trump intelligence&#8230;a true barometer of our country&#8217;s collective brain &#8212; not very impressive in the IQ department!</p>

&#8220;less certain&#8221;&#8230; you were never going to vote for Obama, so give it a break. Vote for John McCain, and watch his 72 years of &#8220;experience&#8221; get us into World War III. To me, McCain is frightening&#8230; dementia is starting to set in.</p>

			<p>How one can be undecided between Obama and McCain is beyond disbelief, particularly after the Republicans&#8217; tragic mismanagement of our government for the last eight years. But hey, to each his (or her) own. As for Obama&#8217;s speech, I think it would be wonderful for Americans to see that we are not all hated around the world (just President Bush) and it would be great for Europeans to see that Americans actually value their friendship and hope to see our relationship improve after the Bush regime is finally over. Good luck Mr. Obama!</p>

<p>Voters would be wise to vote on substance and not this cult of personality that surrounds Senator Obama. Please let us not forget that 4 short years ago he was an Illinois State legislator.</p>
