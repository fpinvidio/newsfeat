<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Would you like to spend a day with Bill Clinton, followed by a free weekend in New York City? Would you like to attend the season finale of American Idol? Would you like to talk politics over lunch with James Carville and Paul Begala?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is not a game show, but rather three potential prizes in exchange for helping to retire the <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2008/06/10/us/politics/10clinton.html">presidential campaign debt</a> for Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">An unusual fund-raising appeal arrived in the e-mail boxes of prospective donors on Thursday afternoon. It’s the latest effort to pay down the campaign debt that Mrs. Clinton racked up during her long primary challenge with President Obama.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“I knew it was going to take an extraordinary effort to help pay off Hillary Clinton’s campaign debt. But now, I think we can do it and have some fun at the same time!” Mr. Carville wrote in the fund-raising appeal. “I won’t spend a lot of time trying to convince you to help Hillary. I know what she means to you, and I’m sure you know how important it is for her to have her campaign pay off all its obligations.” <span id="more-14763"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As Secretary of State in the Obama administration, Mrs. Clinton cannot take part in her own fund-raising efforts. So she has turned to her loyal circle of supporters – along with her husband’s – to help pay down the bills (even if she kisses off the personal loans she made to the campaign.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With contributions in a slump – particularly for someone like Mrs. Clinton who is no longer in the day-to-day business of politicking – fund-raising organizers have taken to finding creative ways to raise money. Winning a day with Mr. Clinton, a ringside seat to American Idol or a lunch with two Democratic operatives is the latest volley.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“Your contribution today not only gives you the chance at winning one of these fantastic prizes &#8211; it&#8217;ll also help our dear friend, Hillary Clinton, pay off the very last of her campaign debt,” Mr. Carville said. “This means a whole lot to Hillary, and I know she appreciates everything you do for her.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton said that the campaign debt was $5.9 million at the end of last year, and a new financial report is due April 15.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So still need to think about it?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“These amazing prizes are only being offered online and are available only for a limited time,” Mr. Carville said. “So please don&#8217;t delay in acting today.”</p>

			<p>We need to do better by this woman. She has done so much for this country. For foster children, vets, mothers, healthcare&#8230;She had a historic run not just for women, she ran for all of us. This is not her debt, it&#8217;s OURS. We can clear this balance up the same way we won this election. Together.</p>

			<p>Sammie (# 1), if she was, say, languishing in a debtors&#8217; prison, your call to action might move me. </p>
<p>But Bill is still pulling in thousands of dollars for speaking engagements, and Chelsea has that not-too-shabby hedge fund salary; I think they&#8217;re doing just fine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got debts of my own, thank you very much, that I did not run up contesting a primary long after it was over.</p>

			<p>a) She should be given credit for trying to pay down the debt.  b) The &#8216;prizes&#8217; as they call it are worth having.

			<p>The only prize I would appreciate more than meeting with President Clinton, Carville or Begala would be spending some time with Secretary of State Clinton.  Although such an  amazing opportunity was not offered,  I feel a debt of gratitude to Hillary and her service to our country.   She will always have my support and respect.</p>

			<p>I think all of us that supported Mrs Clinton should surely try to hel her clear her debt. she has done a lot for women in this country and I certainly will help her, and will continue to pray for her. I accept the roll/Job she was given by the President. and I know she will do a great job. I know the economy is bad but I hope all of us that supported her to crack the glass ceiling will come forward to help Mrs Clinton clear her debt.</p>
<p>God Bless you all</p>

			<p>There&#8217;s an implicit assumption here that all of Mark Penn&#8217;s bills are legitimate. He is a fraud and a liar (see Stan Greenburg, et. al.) and how anyone can trust his bills is beyond me. If Terry McAuliffe signed a statement that all of Penn&#8217;s bills had solid and verfied back up, I&#8217;d contribute, despite the fact this incompetent fool blew the election for Hillary. (Note to Mark Penn&#8217;s clients at Burson-Marsteller and WPP Group&#8211; check his bills! You&#8217;re not married to the guy either.)</p>

<p>The idea that the nomination battle was &#8220;over&#8221; anytime before the last primary was a myth propagated by the Obama campaign, Democratic elders, and the<br />
media. You may recall that it was carefully orchestrated endorsements by the superdelegates in the final week that made it obvious which candidate the Democratic leadership would be selecting. In 1980,trailing Carter by a lot more than the razor thin margin separating Clinton and Obama,Ted Kennedy took his fight all the way to the convention, and did not concede until the second to the last day of the convention. I don&#8217;t recall anyone in the Democratic leadership or within the media mocking Kennedy for battling on, nor would it have occurred to anyone to deny Kennedy a formal roll call.</p>
<p>Have you ever asked yourself why Hillary received a very different treatment?</p>

			<p>Addendum to post #12:</p>
<p>&#8220;By June 3, 1980, when the last Democratic primary was held in West Virginia, Carter had an insurmountable lead. He had pulled 51 percent of the primary votes with Kennedy at 37 percent. Before the convention even opened, Carter had 315 votes more than he needed for the nomination. But Kennedy refused to withdraw. Not until he lost trying to break the rule that bound the delegates to vote on the first ballot for their candidate did Kennedy give in.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Carolyn, interesting that you cite Kennedy trying to break a rule at the convention in 1980. I believe that you were one of those shouting from the rooftops that all the Michigan and Florida delegates should be seated in spite of the fact that both states broke the rules. I think it was only with those delegates that Clinton was close to Obama when she loaned so much money to her campaign.</p>
<p>I assume that you&#8217;re going to be making a hefty contribution to help Hillary retire her debt so that she can enter the primary race in 2012.</p>

			<p>Although I had no liking for the Clintons and felt grave doubts when President Obama appointed Hillary Clinton secretary of state, I must say I think she has perfomed admirably so far. Still, I don&#8217;t feel at all inclined to reward her for her conduct during the campaign.</p>
<p>She and Mark Penn should sit down and come up with a figure that reflects the true value of his contribution to her campaign. This should result in a refund from Penn to the campaign of any money already paid, from which she can pay off her other creditors.</p>

<p>Alas, I maxed out during the primaries &#8211; and more.</p>
<p>Hopeful #17</p>
<p>The idea that Hillary shouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;rewarded&#8221; for &#8220;her behavior&#8221;  &#8212; waging a tough competitive campaign, just like Obama, carrying that battle through until the end of the primary season, just like Obama, graciously withdrawing when she had every right to continue straight through until the convention, just like Kennedy, and then, unlike Kennedy, working her heart out to help elect the Democratic nominee &#8212; strikes me as meanspirited in the extreme. </p>
<p>Preceisely what &#8220;behavior&#8221; are you referring to?</p>

			<p>Carolyn (Rodham), </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take your word as to what went down in 1980, as I was only 2 years old at the time. </p>
<p>I do remember 1992 and 1996 pretty well, and don&#8217;t recall Clinton having any problem with a primary/caucus system that was suddenly, in 2008, &#8220;undemocratic.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I also remember how before the first primary vote was cast in 2008, Hillary had already locked in hundreds of superdelegates, whose endorsements were somehow valid, unlike those that waited until May or June.  </p>
<p>Hillary&#8217;s early campaign strategy was clearly intended to portray her as the inevitable choice.  To say that she was not the establishment candidate, and that she was betrayed somehow by the &#8220;system,&#8221; is laughable. </p>
<p>Regardless, no problem with the job she&#8217;d been doing as Sec. of State &#8211; I just can&#8217;t understand why one of the wealthiest Americans would be soliciting donations from the rest of us.  If people have that much money to burn, I can think of hundreds of causes that would benefit people in much greater need.</p>

<p>I agree that Hillary&#8217;s (or rather Mark Penn&#8217;s) early strategy was to present her nomination as inevitable, and yes, she sought out the endorsements of one hundred superdelegates before the first vote was cast &#8212; one hundred out of over 850. </p>
<p>But to say that Hillary was the &#8220;establishment candidate&#8221; ignores how ambivalently many in the Democratic leadership(and the media)  felt about her candidacy &#8212; a fact that became glaringly obvious the night of the Iowa caucuses when Chris Matthews declared that Hillary&#8217;s candidacy &#8220;has gone from inevitable to improbable&#8221; overnight. Improbable?! Obama led by exactly one pledged delegate at that early stage! It seemed to me that a lot of folks (Democratic leaders, media types) were looking for a reason to jump ship, and jump ship they did, in droves.</p>
<p>I suspect you, like other Hillary detractors, will say she earned that ambivalence &#8212; her famous &#8220;likeability&#8221; problem. But I think when the objective history books are finally written about the 2008 election, it will emerge that subterranean sexism had something to do with the antipathy, if not downright hatred, some people feel towards Hillary. I agree with Howard Dean who recently said &#8212; alas, months after the last primary &#8212; that the most underwritten story of the campaign was what happened to the first viable woman candidate for the Democratic nomination. &#8220;And it happened to Sarah Palin, too,&#8221; he added, &#8220;This is a serious issue this country still has not dealt with.&#8221;</p>

			<p>One more thing, DC:</p>
<p>  I was 27 in 1980, so I can assure you, Kennedy was idolized, not vilified, for carrying on his campaign through the summer. He was considered the heroic standard bearer for the Democratic ideals championed by Roosevelt and by his late brothers.  In fact, he was the keynote speaker at the Democratic national convention. Barack Obama on the other hand chose Mark Warner as his keynote speaker, and engineered the convention such that Hillary&#8217;s 18 million supporters and 1639.5 pledged delegates (to Obama&#8217;s 1766.5) were denied the courtesy of a proper roll call.</p>

<p>Again, I&#8217;ll certainly take your word on Teddy&#8217;s 1980 lionization.  But (and this is an honest question; I don&#8217;t know the answer) did it have anything to do with his policy positions?  In other words, WAS he, in fact, the standard bearer for Rooseveltian ideals?  </p>
<p>If so, the fact that Hillary was not accorded the same treatment in 2008 could simply be due to the fact that she was not an equivalent standard-bearer of a political movement.  I don&#8217;t recall much difference between her and Obama&#8217;s policy positions during the campaign, other than she being for a gas tax holiday and against unconditional talks with leaders of rogue states.  What &#8220;movement&#8221; exactly did she stand for?  Triangulation?  She certainly had no unique claim to being the leader of the &#8220;liberal&#8221; (or the &#8220;moderate&#8221;) wings of the party.  Sure, she billed herself as the more experienced of the two, but, even if you accept that (which many don&#8217;t) that is not the same as being the standard bearer for Rooseveltian ideals.</p>
<p>Regarding sexism, Chris Matthew&#8217;s obnoxiousness does not equate to a vast media conspiracy.  And even if the latter existed, it&#8217;s still ultimately up to the voters.  Were some of them sexist?  Of course; plenty were also racist as hell against blacks.  Not sure how to quantify which effect was stronger &#8211; or what the point of doing so would be. </p>
<p>Also not sure how bringing in Sarah Palin of all people helps &#8211; Hillary&#8217;s qualifications were never seriously in doubt (by educated voters), but Palin&#8217;s?  There were legitimate questions about her qualifications to be a heartbeat away from the Presidency, and I truly, truly do not see what they could possibly have to do with her gender.  My great fear, as a Dem, was that McCain would pick an experienced, moderate woman as his running mate, like Sens. Snowe or Collins or Hutchinson.  Instead, he assumed that ANY woman &#8211; even an inexperienced, far right-wing and rather unintelligent one like Palin &#8211; would be able to attract Hillary&#8217;s supporters.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, the vast majority of her supporters saw right through that, and voted with their brains and not their plumbing.  I know dozens of women who were rabid Hillary supporters, who love her to this day, but by the time the convention rolled around, EVERY ONE of them just wanted to move on and start focusing on McCain.  A roll-call may have been a catharsis, but when the history of the 2008 campain is written, I doubt many will rank it as critical as taking back the White House from a GOP that damn near destroyed this country.</p>

<p>You make many fair observations, but let me refute one or two:</p>
<p>1) When Kennedy campaigned in1980, Carter had been President for four years and was arguably one of our most liberal presidents ever. He and Kennedy were no further apart on the issues than Hillary and Obama. Kennedy saw an opening because of Carter&#8217;s declining popularity as the summer, the economic downturn and the Iran hostage crisis dragged on, and believed he would be the more viable candidate against Reagan. We&#8217;ll never know if he was right, but it&#8217;s truly amazing, when you think about it, that Kennedy carried his fight all the way to the convention against a sitting President who was ahead by a large margin &#8212; and nobody, not the Democratic leadership, not the media, not the voters (of course, we didn&#8217;t have the blogosphere back then) saw any particular problem with that.  He certainly wasn&#8217;t vilified for being  a power-hungry, monomaniacally ambitious, selfish,willing-to-say-or-do-anything-to-win S.O.B. And although his family fortune dwarfs Hillary&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t believe anyone begrudged his fund-raising efforts.</p>
<p>2) Chris Matthews wasn&#8217;t the only media personality with a tingle up his leg for Obama and a decidedly sexist slant on Hillsry&#8217;s candidacy. You can throw in all those middle-aged white guys at MSNBC and virtually everybody at CNN with the exception of Paul Begala (who can forget Alex Castellanis saying Hillary deserved to be called a bit**, or Jamal Simmons saying in April, when asked if he thought Hillary had a valid argument to make to the superdelegates that she would be a stronger candidate against McCain, &#8220;well sure, if my aunt grew a male appendage, she&#8217;d be my uncle, but it ain&#8217;t happenin&#8217;, Hillary!&#8221;) Like it or not, the media plays a role in shaping the narrative or an election and shaping voters&#8217; perceptions.<br />
3) There were many valid objections to raise about Palin&#8217;s qualifications, but the fact of the matter is that for the first week or so after McCain announced his choice, all we heard about was her reproductive history,  her fitness as a mother, her ability to juggle the demands of career and family, etc. Questioning her other qualifications was not sexist, but vilifying her for choosing to fly back to Alaska to deliver her youngest child, or choosing to expose her fetus to the risks of amniocentesis, or accepting McCain&#8217;s offer when she had a child with special needs to tend to &#8212; that was most definitely sexist.</p>

			<p>In the first three months of the year, Hillary Clinton paid off $3.7 million in bills left over from her failed presidential campaign, according to a report her campaign filed Wednesday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission.The report shows that Clinton has only one vendor left to pay off: pollster Mark Penn. Her campaign paid his firm $3 million in the first quarter, but still owes it $2.3 million. The filing also reveals that the campaign brought in $5.6 million between January 1 and March 31, an impressive sum given that Clinton has relied on surrogates to raise money to pay off her debts since January, when she was confirmed as secretary of state for her Democratic primary rival, President Barack Obama. Ethics rules and tradition restrict diplomats from engaging in partisan political activity, including raising cash to pay off the debt. Though Clinton had $2.6 million in the bank at the end of March, she couldn&#8217;t use that to pay off the remainder of the Penn debt because her campaign operation still has overhead costs it needs to pay. For instance, in the first quarter, the campaign paid $9,400 in salary to staffers in New York and Washington, plus $2,300 in phone services, $7,000 for website maintenance and $30,000 in travel costs.</p>
