Therefore, the warn­ing that he who, as an American, re­joices at the enemy’s victories — and Ger­many certainly is an enemy — or mali­ciously discusses possible misfortunes of the United States, displays the lack of loyalty that is liable to punishment.\n“As for the ‘enemy aliens,’ however, who make merry over America’s under­takings, who praise Hindenburg as if he were not America’s arch-enemy, they will be interned — the warning is plain enough. So in the future don’t laugh, do not even grin; not only hold your tongue, but also close your lips.”—Ex­change Telegraph Company. — The New York Herald, European Edition, May 28, 1917", "url": "https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/05/28/1917-pro-german-gloaters-listed-by-federal-agents/"}
