The bank has also seen a number of high-level departures in its executive ranks this year.\nThe sale of the Spanish unit includes retail banking, wealth and investment management, and corporate banking businesses. It does not include investment banking or credit card operations.\nBarclays also said on Sunday that it would record a gain of around 119 million pounds, or $197 million, after completing the sale of its retail business in the United Arab Emirates to Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank.\n“I am pleased to be announcing further progress on Barclays noncore asset reductions through the transactions announced today,” Antony P. Jenkins, Barclays group chief executive, said in a statement on Sunday. “We remain on track to rebalance Barclays as part of our strategy to deliver sustainable returns for our shareholders.”", "url": "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/barclays-to-sell-retail-and-corporate-bank-units-to-caixabank-of-spain/"}
