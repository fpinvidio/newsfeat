Considers Rules to Force Bondholders to Share Cost of Restructuring  - The New York Times", "title_rss": "NULL", "source_domain": "nytimes.com", "text": "Photo\nBRETTON WOODS, N.H. — The International Monetary Fund is moving closer to formalizing standards that would give it the option to require private-sector bondholders to share the financial burden when countries with serious debt problems seek assistance from the fund.\nThe new approach marks the latest evolution in the fund’s thinking about the thorny and politically fraught issue of how and when to determine that a country’s debt is no longer sustainable and, crucially, to what extent private sector bondholders should be required to share in the cost of restructuring as opposed to taxpayers’ bailing out the country.\nFund officials, investors and academics discussed the issue on Thursday at a conference to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Bretton Woods system of global financial cooperation.\nThe push for more private-sector participation in future debt restructurings underscores mounting concern on the part of global policy makers that, after the messy debt drama in Greece and the success holdout hedge funds have had in compelling Argentina to pay them, the ground rules for sovereign debt restructurings need to be clarified.\nThe fund’s proposal, which would lock in private sector bond investors by having their maturities extended so that they could not cut and run, faces opposition from many investors and their trade organizations.\nThe United States Treasury, which has long resisted attempts by the fund to formalize the process of restructuring sovereign debts, has also been skeptical of the plan.\nBut after more than a year of consulting with market experts and academics, fund officials think that the time has come to update its policy tool kit. They also believe they have addressed previous complaints from investors that this new approach would represent a move toward big bond haircuts.\nIf the new approach is approved by the executive board, it could become official fund policy early next year.\n“I think this is the right way to go — we need more tools in addressing these issues,” said Richard Portes, an economist at the London Business School who is also an expert on sovereign debt.\nStill, with investors having piled into risky government bonds in Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece in a frantic search for yield, the move may ignite fears that they will be on the hook the next time a country goes to the I.M.F. for help.\n“I think the fund is talking some brave talk on this, but there is still concern in the market,” said Whitney Debevoise, a sovereign debt specialist at the law firm Arnold & Porter in Washington.\nOfficials first began circulating papers on the topic about a year ago. The plan came under fire at the time, with critics contending that it reflected a bias on the part of the fund to make investors take more losses during the next round of debt restructurings. As a result, they said, countries would refrain from seeking help from the fund, fearing the stigma of having their bonds reworked.\nThe latest paper has been recast to show that the private sector participation approach would not be the presumed option but would only be deployed if it became clear that the country’s debt was too much of a burden.\nThe new push is the fruit of more than a year of discussion within the fund about the lessons to be learned from Greece. Fund officials have been quite vocal in saying that they should have pushed sooner for a debt restructuring there and that the two-year delay that ensued from the initial bailout in 2010 to the debt restructuring in 2012 caused serious harm not just to Greece but the euro zone as a whole.\nAt the time of the Greek crisis, the fund had two options: conclude that Greece’s debt — about 130 percent of gross domestic product at the time — was too high and insist on a debt restructuring before agreeing to lend money to the country; or diagnose Greece’s financing problems as short term and lend it money on the condition that it make serious economic reforms.\nUnder pressure from European officials who feared contagion if Greece restructured its debt in 2010, the fund instead came up with a new rule: a so-called systemic exemption that would allow it to lend to a country like Greece even though there was little chance that it could pay back its debt.\nTo not bail out Greece, Europeans were saying at the time, would create a market panic. The belief now is that the systemic exemption only made things worse as contagion spread just the same.\nWith a debt level of about 170 percent of economic output, Greece’s debt burden is much higher now than it was at the time of its first bailout in 2010. In the interim, the country’s economy has shrunk by a quarter and unemployment has soared to 25 percent.\nUnder the new proposal, its hoped that the next time a country with serious debt problems approaches the fund, the painful but necessary debt restructuring happens sooner rather than later.", "url": "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/04/i-m-f-considers-rules-to-force-bondholders-to-share-cost-of-restructuring/"}
