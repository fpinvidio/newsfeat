<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Vice Chancellor Stephen P. Lamb ruled decisively for <strong>Huntsman</strong> in his 89-page opinion (as I predicted he would in my previous post, <a href="//dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/last-words-from-huntsman-and-hexion/">&#8220;Last Words From Huntsman and Hexion&#8221;</a>). </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In his opinion, Judge Lamb found that Huntsman had not suffered a material adverse effect, and that <strong>Hexion Specialty Chemicals</strong> &#8212; which, along with its private equity backer, <strong>Apollo Management</strong>, had sued to end its deal with Huntsman &#8212; had knowingly and intentionally breached the merger agreement. The court refused at this time to rule on Hexion&#8217;s claim that the combined company would be insolvent, instead ordering Hexion to comply with its obligations under the merger agreement to attempt to complete the merger.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the opinion are a number of lessons for deal lawyers: <span id="more-27022"></span></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">* A material adverse change, or MAC, is tough to prove. Judge Lamb noted in his opinion that no Delaware court had ever found for a buyer on a MAC claim. He relied heavily on Vice Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr.&#8217;s opinion in IBP v. Tyson to describe a MAC as being a &#8220;significantly durational&#8221; adverse event &#8220;expected to persist in the future.&#8221; In Huntsman&#8217;s case, there was no MAC in its business, since Huntsman&#8217;s 2007 EBITDA was only 3 percent below its 2006 EBITDA and 2008 EBITDA will only be 7 percent below 2007 EBITDA. Notably, Judge Lamb found that since EBITDA is independent of capital structure, it is a better measure of the operational results of a business for determining a MAC.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">* Non-reliance language on projections has a broad application. According to forecasts from Huntsman management, Huntsman&#8217;s EBITDA projections for 2008 have gone from $1.289 billion as of June 2007 to $863 billion at the time of trial, a significant decline. However, Judge Lamb refused to consider these projections, instead preferring a year-to-year comparison of results to ascertain a MAC. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He refused to rely on these projections because of standard disclaimers about reliance on projections in the merger agreement. And he implied that he would have done so, even without this disclaimer language, as actual year-to-year performance is a better measure of a MAC.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">* A MAC determination is based on the business as a whole. Judge Lamb looked at the entire Huntsman business to determine whether a MAC had occurred and thereby isolated the significant declines in Huntsman&#8217;s pigments and textiles business.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">* The carve-outs to the MAC only come into play if there is first a material adverse change. Judge Lamb rejected Hexion&#8217;s argument that &#8220;the relevant standard to apply in judging whether an MAE has occurred is to compare Huntsman&#8217;s performance since the signing of the merger agreement and its expected future performance to the rest of the chemical industry.&#8221; Hexion made this argument based on an exclusion in the MAC clause for changes to the chemical industry generally. Instead, Judge Lamb first looked to whether a material adverse change had occurred to the Huntsman business before even turning to the exclusions. Since he found that no such material adverse change had occurred, he never looked at the exclusions.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">* We still need to know how to measure disproportionality. Because Judge Lamb found that the exclusions to the MAC need not be considered, how these exclusions are read, particularly the term &#8220;disproportionality,&#8221; is still an open question. As an aside, the Genesco/Finish Line opinion was not even cited in this one, confirming its status as an outlier.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">* The MAC burden is on the buyer, unless otherwise agreed. Judge Lamb places the burden to prove a MAC squarely on the buyer, but in a footnote, he notes that the burden of a MAC can be shifted by contract. As might be expected, he repeatedly asserted that the MAC was a creature of contract and its interpretation could be altered by the parties.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">* The definition of &#8220;knowing and intentional&#8221; was an issue. Judge Lamb held that a knowing and intentional breach is a deliberate one &#8212; a breach that is a direct consequence of a deliberate act undertaken by the breaching party, rather than one which results indirectly, or as a result of the breaching party&#8217;s negligence or unforeseeable misadventure. As he stated, &#8220;[i]n other words, a &#8216;knowing and intentional&#8217; breach, as used in the merger agreement, is the taking of a deliberate act, which act constitutes in and of itself a breach of the merger agreement, even if breaching was not the conscious object of the act.&#8221; Attorneys should be aware of this definition (which heavily favors sellers) when negotiating agreements in the future.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">* Parol evidence matters. Judge Lamb found the contract language on specific performance ambiguous. So he looked to the parol evidence &#8212; the evidence outside the contract &#8212; to determine its meaning. He then examined the proxy language and the testimony of Andy Nussbaum of law firm <strong>Wachtell Lipton Rosen &#038; Katz</strong> to find that the contract allowed specific performance in all cases except for requiring Hexion to actually complete the merger. Previously, this proxy language was something that a junior associate would draft. But now, in light of this decision and the one in Cerberus/United Rentals, expect a heightened focus on scripting negotiations and proxy disclosure of the agreement.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">* Every document is a litigation tool. This problem was highlighted repeatedly in this case. Judge Lamb looked scornfully on Hexions&#8217;s internal projections from May 9, 2008, and particularly cited the May 16, 2008, notes of Allen Pfeiffer of <strong>Duff &#038; Phelps</strong>, which read: &#8220;get out. (1) Notice that insufficient capital to close (2) [Apollo] hiring D&#038;P to support that notion.&#8221; Similarly, a junior banker at <strong>Merrill Lynch</strong> ran some numbers and, said in writing that the combined company looked insolvent. In all of these cases, these facts did not overtly affect Judge Lamb&#8217;s opinion, but they emphasize the need to have lawyers involved in every stage of the negotiation and thereafter guiding the process.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ultimately, Judge Lamb&#8217;s ruling is quite damaging, not only to Hexion but to Apollo. By finding that Hexion had knowing and intentionally breached, he provides ammunition to Huntsman in its tortious interference case in Texas.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Moreover, Hexion is now under judicial orders to attempt to close the transaction. Ultimately, Judge Lamb adopted my interpretation of this agreement way back in January in <a href="//dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/11/huntsman-hexion-a-deal-agreement-to-applaud/">&#8220;Huntsman: a Deal Agreement to Applaud.&#8221;</a> But he also agreed with my thoughts that the specific performance language in the agreement makes no sense. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">No one gave a convincing reason at trial to explain it, so ultimately we are left to scratch our heads and wonder if there was a simple mistake here. Nonetheless, Huntsman benefits here as Judge Lamb interpreted it to mean that specific performance is required for everything but the completion of the merger.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So Hexion must now send over a markup of financing docs and set up a virtual closing &#8212; to which the banks will not show up. But I am not sure they have to do much else &#8212; perhaps sue in New York. Since no doubt the financing is dependent on a closing, I am not sure they have to even sue in New York if they determine that regardless of the outcome, they will not close the merger.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">However, the way Judge Lamb has defined a knowing and intentional breach has backed Hexion into a corner. He has already found them in breach with possible, uncapped damages, and also found that Hexion has the burden of demonstrating that any harm to Huntsman was not caused by such breach. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He didn&#8217;t say it directly, but he also strongly implied, by defining knowledge in this way, that if the financing fails and Hexion refuses to close, they are out of luck and subject to uncapped damages. He also implied that he didn&#8217;t think much of Hexion&#8217;s solvency argument and that it was manipulated by the pension numbers, the inclusion of a $100 million fee by Apollo and Huntsman&#8217;s allegedly deliberate failure to obtain as much for its asset divestitures.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This normally would be bad for Apollo, but it is a confined loss since it would mean that they would lose Hexion either through bankruptcy or simply turning it over to Huntsman. However, the Texas action and the salacious facts Huntsman is alleging there (plus the breaches here) give credibility to Huntsman&#8217;s tortious-interference-of-contract claim in that state. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Judge Lamb has ruled in a way that provides maximum damage to Apollo, and congratulations must go to <strong>Vinson &#038; Elkins</strong> for obtaining this ruling (and apologies by me to them to the extent that I wrongfully thought that Judge Lamb would ignore this argument).</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">However, this is merely a midterm report. We now need to see what Hexion does. I suspect they will pursue the financing and let the banks do the dirty work for a bit. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Essentially, we are back into a Genesco/Finish Line/UBS scenario. Huntsman has won a big victory but still has a ways to go to bring this to a close. An appeal in Delaware is unlikely to succeed given Delaware&#8217;s penchant for upholding its Chancery Court decisions, particularly those as fact-based as this one. The action will now shift to New York for a possible suit between the lenders and Hexion (with Huntsman intervening as the real party in interest), and to Texas for a certain suit by Huntsman against Hexion, Apollo and the lenders among others.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But this is all coda. As of Tuesday, the date of this opinion and the Jewish New Year, I am calling an official end to the private equity era.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Addendum</strong>: A few readers have pointed out to me that I was a bit hasty in positing that Apollo could get out of this mess by either having Hexion declare bankruptcy or simply giving the company to Huntsman.  Beyond the issue of the pending Texas action, both of these have their own downsides.  In a bankruptcy, Apollo will possibly lose control of Hexion &#8212; and it could have liability exposure itself from Hexion bondholders, who may have causes of actions themselves (piercing the corporate veil, etc.). </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Additionally, Apollo cannot simply put Hexion to Huntsman, as this would be deemed a change of control under the bond indentures. I believe that Apollo/Hexion would need Hexion&#8217;s bondholder approval before doing that. I have not done the credit analysis, but perhaps bondholders would be pleased in this scenario. Again, these problems highlight the dilemma Apollo now faces.</p>

			<p>You say that the opinion is damaging to Apollo, but it&#8217;s rather obvious that Wachtell looks even worse.  One might expect Apollo to behave so aggressively, but you&#8217;d expect a more sensible approach from such esteemed counsel.  They devised Apollo&#8217;s litigation strategy from the very beginning and seemed to have provided them advice that sent them directly into a &#8220;knowing and intentional breach&#8221; when they could have just sat back and let the banks do their dirty work.  Not good lawyering.</p>

			<p>What this blog, otherwise a terrific commentary, doesn&#8217;t address is how the Lamb decision changes the settlement bargaining calculus among these parties very substantially in Huntsman&#8217;s favor.   In Lamb&#8217;s courtroom in a damages suit, only Hexion is on the line.  In Texas the defendants include not only Hexion, but substantially all the Apollo investment partnerships,  the Apollo investment managing entity and Leon Black and Josh Harris.   And now the funding banks I presume are named parties.  So like Clear Channel and Genesco, the interests of Hexion, Apollo and its banks are not quite so alligned as they were on the day before Lamb&#8217;s decision.  Now Hexion/Apollo need to keep the banks on the hook to contribute to a settlement as they are among the most significant beneficiaries of a busted deal.   That contribution could come as cash or in the form of a new credit agreement for a new deal a la CCU.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible we are now talking economic damages in excess of $5 billion.   Before the Lamb decision that number was at most $325 million.   Faced with a Texas jury, is it inconceivable that Apollo might accept a lower return and inject equity into the deal?   Might now the banks reluctantly agree to fund a deal with a lower level of debt (and dependent on whether they have internally marked a loss on the commitment) now book an internal gain on a deal recut.  Might now Jon and Peter Huntsman who have clearly scored a win and vindicated their company in Delaware, now accept  a 15 to 20% price reduction?  Could the parties alternatively settle with a cash and Hexion stock consideration in excess of $2 billion?</p>
<p>I have many many unanswered questions.  Particularly about the indemnification and contribution arrangements among the Apollo investment funds,  the general manager and the officers of such manager.  And of the public policy legality of such arrangements.</p>
<p>Nothing is going to happen quickly here.  And one has to take a lot of bets off the table here if somehow the Texas action is dismissed.</p>
<p>Perhaps Hexion will appeal; most likely on the finding of law as to what &#8220;knowing and intentional&#8221; breach is. ( I don&#8217;t think they have any basis to challenge the &#8220;no MAE&#8221; ruling. )  But the Lamb definition as &#8220;deliberate&#8221; has a lot of appeal to me (no pun intended).   After all Apollo &#8220;deliberately&#8221; sent the Duff and Phelps solvency opinion &#8220;book&#8221; over to the banks without any reason to do so.  I&#8217;m thinking the appeal is a sideshow.</p>
<p>Next stop is New York.  Then we will find out if the banks can look further than &#8220;the four corners of&#8221; the solvency opinion that American Appraisal has provided;  if &#8220;money is fungible&#8221; and perhaps if banks can manipulate final credit documents substantially from the plain meaning of commitment letter term sheets.  </p>
<p>Even if the banks win in NY, they are still on the hook in Texas (with Apollo and its two officers).  But perhaps with not as much risk. </p>
<p>And Hexion has a damages suit in DE.</p>

			<p>You did not predict the outcome, that lamb would artfully avoid the solvency and performance issue by finding a knowing and intentional breach resulting in uncapped damages, handing enormous leverage to huntsman to force a successful outcome while avoiding the ancillary issues.  You called the breach issue a cart before the horse issue, and were flat wrong there.  You have in fact been wrong  on this case from the beginning.  You loudly applauded wachtell for an artful strategy in attempting to avoid the contract, see previous post on the the original filing, when in fact this sham was the root problem in the case.  Lamb goes out of his way in stinging detail to deride this as a naked contrivance that has left the client open to billions in damages.   You very noticably avoid any reference to the full history, or your complete predictions on the matter.   You do not make plain that the legal strategy on the apollo side was deeply flawed, and that the judge called that out time and again. You do not take wachtell to task for the too clever by half strategy here, as you are driven to do with others.  Practicing attorneys would do well to check your predictions and classroom scoldings with a heavy dose of the facts.  Teaching is very different from practicing, and your meandering, self congratulatory approach on this matter once again demonstrates the enormous distance between the classroom and the courtroom.  The lesson here is not about mac interpretations or drafting.  It is this &#8212; playing games to create leverage under a contract in bad faith is always a bad idea, professor.</p>

			<p>Given Huntsman’s definitive win over Hexion, why is the stock trading below 40% of the purchase price?  If the banks refuse to fund they will be sued by Hexion, and if the deal does not close Huntsman will sue Hexion for uncapped liabilities.  Worst case is that Huntsman takes ownership of Hexion (sans Apollo and sans incremental leverage), correct?  This would imply a significantly higher stock price than where it currently trades.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve been reading all of your articles and have found you to be right on&#8230; Do you think Hexion &amp; Apollo will eventually decide to buy HUN for say $20 to $24 per share in return for HUN agreeing to drop all suits, or do you think this will drag out for years?</p>

			<p>what i don&#8217;t understand is why you think the banks have some leverage.  My understanding is that they committed to do the financing.  It seems that the argument about insolvency is a loser.  With the texas case against them seeking specific performance, i&#8217;m not sure what choices the banks have.  It seems the banks will have to finance and then the banks will go after hexion.   What am i missing here?</p>

			<p>What a great commentary, Professor.  I find particularly interesting your observation that you think Hexion will pursue the financing as opposed to trying to move straight to a payout to Huntsman.</p>
<p>I blogged about this case yesterday, opining, as did North Fork Investor several posts up, that this debacle could potentially settle for $3-ish billion.  As a practical matter, I doubt $3 billion is a realistic number, but I assumed the parties would move straight to settlement.  It will be interesting to see how this plays out.  Thanks for covering it.</p>

			<p>What I wonder is:  if the banks are eventually forced to fund (ie. no insolvency), then may Huntsman become a third-party beneficiary of the Commitment Letters such that a judge (perhaps Lamb or one in NY) can order the banks to pay the money directly to the Huntsman shareholders in return for their shares?  Or, may Huntsman obtain an order enjoining a Hexion bankruptcy filing and the merger then be closed?  Can a bankruptcy filing ever be enjoined or does every company have a right to &#8220;die?&#8221;  In other words, why aren&#8217;t we hearing more about Section 7.4 of the Definitive Agreement and its last proviso?</p>

			<p>This was a simple case of common sense from day one(as I have posted many threads ago)-the act of going behind Huntsman&#8217;s back to obtain the &#8220;insolvency&#8221; opinion from D&amp;P while telling them they should not contact Huntsman in formulating their opinion was a clear cut case of willing and intentional breach!! It is the direct opposite of &#8220;reasonable best efforts&#8221; required by Hexion to close the merger. This act of bad faith alone was enough to nail Hexion for breach of contract and maximum damages.<br />
I&#8217;m glad the judge had the common sense to see it how it was!</p>

			<p>I am not sure I understand the dig in the last sentence, and the apparent bias it seems to reflect, against private equity.  WIth all due respect, I am not sure I understand what it means.  There is plenty of private equity money waiting to be spent (eventually, when credit is finally available again), and there will of course be more going private deals. What I think you tend to rail against is the optionality that most PE firms are able to negotiate into going private deals, but I am not sure the market has changed anymore in sellers&#8217; favor.  In fact, such optionality, in my humble opinion, is still solidly consistent with the current state of &#8220;market.&#8221;  May I please request an elaboration on the &#8220;official end of private equity&#8221; and some insight as to whether you have distaste in principle for the private equity model?  (In fairness, I suspect your distaste is actually for the pro-buyer results negotiated by sellers&#8217; counsels in going private agreements.)<br />
Keep up the great work; very much look forward to your regular posts.</p>

			<p>in reading the ruling the evidence of a &#8220;knowing and intentional breach&#8221; was pretty powerful.  This evidence, rather than the actual ruling, should be interesting in the Texas case. i doubt if the ruling itself gets much weight.</p>
