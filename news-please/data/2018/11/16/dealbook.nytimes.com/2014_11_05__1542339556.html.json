ING intends to fully divest its holdings in NN by the end of 2016.\nIn September, ING cut its stake in Voya Financial, formerly called ING U.S., to 32 percent. ING spun off Voya in an I.P.O. last year.\nING has also sold its online bank in the United States to Capital One Financial Corporation.\nOn Wednesday, ING also announced that its third-quarter profit was significantly higher than in the same quarter a year earlier, on better returns on its lending and lower provisions on bad loans.\nFor the three months ended Sept. 30, ING said that profit rose to €928 million, up from €128 million in the quarter a year earlier but still below analysts’ expectations.\nOn a pretax, underlying basis, profit rose 34.7 percent to €1.49 billion. Underlying results exclude certain costs and the results of its discontinued businesses.", "url": "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/ing-group-moves-up-final-payment-to-dutch-government/"}
