<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As the author J. K. Rowling <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2008/04/14/books/14cnd-rowling.html?hp">took the witness stand</a> on Monday to testify in <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2008/04/14/books/14potter.html?">the copyright lawsuit over a Harry Potter encyclopedia</a>, the line between her magical world and the muggle courtroom became somewhat blurred. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The lead plaintiff lawyer apologized for saying the name of the villain <a href="//lord-voldemort.org/voldemort/bio.php">Lord Voldemort</a> out loud. Albus Dumbledore was quoted in opening arguments for his admonition of when you must &#8220;choose between what is right and what is easy.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Rowling, when asked to define what wizard cards were, explained in a matter-of-fact matter that they were cards of famous wizards that came with the purchase of a chocolate frogs. (Her lawyer had to explain to the judge that outside the books the cards only existed in a video game). And while the lawsuit was filed on Oct. 31, the lawyers noted, &#8220;The fact it was filed on Halloween, your honor, was just a coincidence.&#8221;<br />
<span id="more-2579"></span><br />
The material entered into evidence related to flying carpets, rune stones, ogres, a werewolf who was a metaphor for H.I.V.-positive individuals, the pet phoenix named in honor of Guy Fawkes, a real-life Renaissance-era alchemist named <a href="//www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/paracelsus/paracelsus_2.html ">Paracelsus</a>, who was cited as a wizard in Ms. Rowling&#8217;s series.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The crux of the debate was whether or not &#8220;The Harry Potter Lexicon,&#8221; based on <a href="//www.hp-lexicon.org/">a similarly named fan site</a> created by Steven Vander Ark, was &#8220;wholesale theft of 17 years of my hard work,&#8221; as Ms. Rowling argued, or a structured reference work with additional insights, commentary and analysis, as the lawyer for RDR Books, the Michigan-based publisher of the Lexicon, argued. (Mr. Vander Ark is not a party to the case. <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/nyregion/16potter.html">Update: He testified on Tuesday</a>.)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At issue was clearly the power and reach of Ms. Rowling&#8217;s creativity and the literal words used to express them. Too much of the Lexicon are quotes lifted directly from her novels and two other works, she said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When asked to discuss the similarity of the Lexicon&#8217;s definition of Chinese fireballs on the stand with her own writing, she said that it was not like a giraffe, where if she and Mr. Vander Ark were describing the animal, they might inevitably use the same words. &#8220;It&#8217;s not as if we are describing something that exists outside my imagination,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It was clearly an emotional issue for Ms. Rowling, who had flown in from Scotland to testify. She was given a box of blue tissues after she said, &#8220;I really don&#8217;t want to cry because I&#8217;m British.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Harry Potter series represented 17 years of her life &#8220;other than my children&#8221; and the book was a product of times &#8220;when I was choosing literally between food and a typewriter ribbon.&#8221; On her wrist, she wore a charm bracelet given to her by her publisher with trinkets based on the things from the books.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Rowling stated she was not opposed to derivative works, as there have been around one hundred Harry Potter-related books that have been published in the United States alone. (Not to mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx1XIm6q4r4">YouTube puppet shows</a>.) </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Rather, she said she was opposed to how the &#8220;Lexicon&#8221; copied many phrases word-for-word from her book without adding meaningful additional context, adding that some of the work was sloppy or wrong. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;Alohomora,&#8221; a spell that opens doors in Harry Potter&#8217;s word, does not come from &#8220;aloha,&#8221; the Hawaiian salutation, she said on the stand. Rather it derives from a West African term meaning favorable to thieves, she said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Rowling herself has long ago announced plans to compile her own encyclopedia of the Harry Potter world, whose proceeds would go towards charity.  However, the lawsuit was not about the money, but about &#8220;a massive principle&#8221; about precedents for authors, she said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;We all know I&#8217;ve made enough money,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not here because I thought I might sell three fewer novels.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She said she was dispirited by the idea of her own encyclopedia, which would take perhaps two or three years to complete now, because of the Lexicon lawsuit. She associated the project with stress, legal documents and long conversations.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I have the will and heart to continue with the encyclopedia&#8221; should the Lexicon come to market, Ms. Rowling said, adding that she did not want it &#8220;limping onto the marketplace.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The courtroom at the federal court house at 500 Pearl Street was considerably more packed than other copyright cases (like Viacom v. YouTube/Google). There were reporters, law students, copyright groupies, legal scholars and even a young fan or two (shouldn&#8217;t they be in school?).</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Occasionally, the muggle world would come in focus. When the lawyer apologized for struggling with the pronunciation of &#8220;occamy&#8221; (a creature resembling a winged snake that was a play off of Occam&#8217;s Razor), Ms. Rowling said: &#8220;You can pronounce it any way you want. It is not a real thing.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Rowling has a lot of nerve suing anyone.  8 years before &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; Jane Yolen wrote &#8220;Wizards Hall&#8221; with a young budding wizard named Henry and a wicked wizard who wants to destroy the school. </p>
<p>Not to mention Terry Pratchett who also has a long series of pre-Rowling stories with an invisible school for wizards in his Discworld series.</p>
<p>Any originality is in her own mind.</p>

			<p>Does she mean to say that Concordances and Dictionaries of an author&#8217;s work are plagiarism? Is it the quantity of words that have been extracted, rather than the principle of extracting words and phrases? For example, what if Merriam-Webster added &#8220;muggle&#8221; to its dictionary? One word is not an infringement, or how many?</p>

			<p>If Rowling is correct that much of “Lexicon” is sloppy or wrong, then it should not harm her &#8220;authorized&#8221; &#8220;official&#8221; encyclopedia, if her&#8217;s is better, once it comes out.  In the meantime, she should be entitled to demand that Lexicon&#8217;s version be labeled to indicate that it is not the official version written or authorized by JK Rowling.  She and sympathetic readers, websites, etc., can also recommend that readers not purchase the Lexicon version.</p>
<p>On the other hand, copyright law should not prevent those who view Lexicon&#8217;s volume as providing a value-added service &#8211; in the short run, if not the long run &#8211; from purchasing it.  </p>
<p>While Rowlings and her fans may believe that she &#8211; as creator &#8211; deserves to control the ideas in her book in all of their manifestations, copyright law does not grant her property rights in her ideas and it should not enable her to prevent others from being paid to provide value-added services that build on her work.</p>

			<p>Maybe if Vander Ark had engaged in some actual writing, instead of just utilizing his computer&#8217;s copy/past command, he might have a case.  If people want the added value of commentary, they can turn to other sources &#8212; the dozens published in the US alone, say, that Rowling has no problem with.</p>

			<p>I loved her first book&#8230; you know, when she wrote the book for her family. Then she sold out and gave us a poorly written and edited ending. And now she&#8217;s exiling her own fans.</p>
<p>She really has no argument. Yes, someone is profiting off her &#8220;ideas&#8221; (but as Mark Nadel pointed out, her ideas are hardly new). They could have settled that stuff out of court. But nooooooooooo she has to drag it into court. </p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take the Wizengamot to figure out that her greed is through the roof. Spend more time learning to write quality literature rather than picking on your fans, you hack.</p>

			<p>So&#8230;she&#8217;s worried about the accuracy of fictional items entirely in her imagination? She&#8217;d rather lose fans than let someone steal her highly derivative &#8220;work.&#8221; This is a foolish move, one of those lawsuits that hurts the plaintiff even if they win.</p>

			<p>J.K. Rowling has every justification in preventing the Harry Potter Lexicon from publishing its encyclopedia. No one can argue that Rowling does not support her fans, as well as her fans&#8217; initiatives to publish creative and original companions to the Harry Potter books (see: Mugglenet.com&#8217;s NY Times bestseller, &#8220;What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7&#8243;). This is a case a greedy individual taking Rowling&#8217;s work, in many cases word for word, and attempting to publish it for profit. The book lifts 2,034 of its 2,437 entries straight from the the Potter books. The argument that this lawsuit is prompted by Rowling&#8217;s greed cannot be justified, given that the profits of her own encyclopedia would be donated to charity, as was done with two other companion books  written by Rowling between the publication fourth and fifth Potter books. Evidence that Rowling is doing anything but oppress her colossal fan base can be seen on the comments posted on the largest Harry Potter Website, Mugglenet.com. The fans are overwhelming in support of Rowling.</p>

<p>Learn the facts straight before you said something that stupid.</p>
<p>She did try with WB to settle it outside of court but neither RDR and SVA were cooperative. The lawsuit is only the result of RDR refusing to hand the manuscript and/or discuss it with the copyright holders.</p>

			<p>Icy, they DID try to settle it out of court. Rowling&#8217;s lawyers contacted RDR repeatedly over months to discuss this face-to-face, but they refused, and were already promising the book to publishers in various countries despite knowing that Rowling was unhappy with it. Rowling didn&#8217;t have a choice, because RDR simply refused to cooperate.</p>

			<p>Actually, the copyright will extend for 75 years from her death. After that, Harry goes public domain. It used to be 50 years, but we have the late Rep. Sonny Bono and Disney to thank for the extension, all to protect Mickey and Minnie and Donald from passing out of protected copyright status.</p>

			<p>Friend-of-the-Court Brief on Behalf of the Plantiff:  </p>
<p>Our Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office has determined that Mr. Vander Ark and his cohorts at RDR are guilty of theft and of misuse in their attempt to peddle their blatantly harmful transfigurment of Ms. Rowling&#8217;s work as their own for profit.  Should Ms. Rowling (and the Court) desire, we are happy to make an exception for these Muggles and send the dementors to whisk the offenders off to Azkaban.  Please advise by return owl.</p>

<p>Jo has no issue with companion books, it&#8217;s when so much of the material is taken directly from the books, often word for word. *That* part is protected by law. You need additional commentary or insight to get away from that, and this Lexicon book offers very little.</p>

			<p>Steve Vander Ark is no more guilty of theft than any other author of a COMPANION ENCYCLOPAEDIC BOOK, of which there are many. The Tolkien estate didn&#8217;t object to an indepth encyclopaedia about the world of Middle Earth, and authors such as Margaret Attwood, William Shakespeare, George Orwell and Arthur Miller have *all* had extensive study guides published about their works for academic studies *and* for the average reader who wants to know more about the books.</p>
<p>The Harry Potter Lexicon would be exactly the same as those reference works and Rowling is lying from the pit of her stomach by saying the Lexicon is sloppily written; why  would she feel threatened by an awfully written work? She is claiming it is badly written in order to make people ignore the fact she gave the Lexicon a fansite award in 2004!</p>
<p>There is no legal precedent for a research author having to hand over a manuscript to the author of an original work, even if the original author requests this. This is blatant censorship and unenforceable under law. Just because J.K. Rowling and Warner Brothers assume their money and status gives them the right to seize works based on or around their copyright, it doesn&#8217;t give them the legal right.</p>
<p>Her conduct in court yesterday proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Rowling would never have been a Gryffindor.</p>

			<p>Enclycopedias and companion books typically fall under fair use.  However, you still have to follow MLA or APA style or risk being sued for plaigarism. In this regard, the Lexicon has a serious problem. The book does not follow a particular writing stle or format, and poorly cites the information taken directly from the book.  Any student in college who poorly cites a paper, or uses too many direct quotes from their research without adding their own commentary, can be kicked out of school for plaigarism.  </p>
<p>Steve Vander Ark&#8217;s research is so poorly done that it warrants being sued. Had Vander Ark done better research and cited his work properly, he would not be in this mess.</p>
<p>JKR has been incredibly leniant to most fan endeavors, but at some point you have to draw the line.</p>

			<p>JK Rowling is a maniac about suing people and her lawyers earn a lot of money each year thanks to this.</p>
<p>But Rowling herself should be the first one to be sued and she never seems to remember it. She should be more generous, as others have been with her before.</p>
<p>Read the book titled &#8220;Groosham Grange&#8221; by Anthony Horowitz (a British author well known by Rowling).</p>
<p>This book was published years before Harry Potter and won some awards. It&#8217;s the story of a boy, who is not well treated by his family, and who finds out that he is a wizard , goes to a wizard&#8217;s school (as in HP, it is the school who unexpectedly contacts the family offering a place) he goes to school by train and then by boat, yes, just as in the HP books. He meets his best friends in the train (yes, a boy and a girl) on that first trip to the school too. One of his teachers is a worewolf, another one is ghost, etc.  </p>
<p>The least that could be said is that Groosham Grange sets the background of the HP story (The existence of nowdays wizards, unknown for non-magic people. A school of magic for children. The idea of normal children who suddenly, at a fixed age, get aware that have magical powers. Birthdays as triggers to start attending that school of magic. The tale of a boy who is not happy and for whom magic changes his life). All these ideas are original of Anthony Horowitz, but Anthony Horowitz never sued JK Rowling, while Rowling has a long list of court battles against all kind of people for using anything related to her &#8220;original&#8221; ideas, including a poor Russian author who wrote about a witch girl.</p>
<p>Horowitz&#8217;s book is good but Rowling&#8217;s is better. HP&#8217;s plot is far more interesting (the idea of fighting the evil and powerful Voldemort and that of Harry being special because he survived), more complicated, with much more characters and the characters are better developped (Horowitz&#8217;s book is much shorter)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why she sold so many books and become rich. </p>
<p>But she shouldn&#8217;t forbid other people to try and write what they want. Because the ideas of a magical world and a wizard boy ARE NOT HERS. She should be more generous and not sue everybody who writes about anything related to her own books. If Horowitz had sued her and forbidden her to write Harry Potter, readers would have been deprived of HP!</p>

			<p>I strongly disagree with those who think of Rowling as controlling and avaricious. Rowling is one of the least controlling of writers I know of. </p>
<p>What I worry most is this: will this case become a precedent for the writing and publishing of other third party reference materials? As an academic and a writer, this is what worries me the most. What will determine acceptable fair use, and what will not? *How* the judge determines the winner or loser of this case is more important than who wins or who loses.</p>

			<p>Here we are again, trying to figure out who owns what copyright.</p>
<p>Mr. Vander Ark, if anyone cares to check it out, used to be part of a Star Trek fan club in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Back then lots of Trek fans were writing and publishing their own stories, novels, novellas, etc.  Interestingly enough, Paramount and Roddenberry felt that allowing original stories would further their own cause &#8212; and that led to all the new series after Star Trek Classic.  Unfortunately, other copyright holders might not see such publications as an advantage.</p>
<p>I guess I need to give credit where credit is due for this next comment so that I will not violate anyone&#8217;s alleged copyright.</p>
<p>&#8220;GET A LIFE!!&#8221; &#8212; William Shatner</p>
<p>Harry Potter, just like Star Trek, is just that &#8212; brain candy.  Pure and simple.</p>

			<p>At the heart of this case is the issue of copyright and fair use. Mr. Vander Ark has gone way past the usual allowances of fair use. While other books in the past may have dealt with magical worlds and boy wizards, the fact that outside influences may have inspired Ms. Rowling’s work does not mean that she is devoid of ownership over her 17 years of hard work. Mr. Vander Ark is not publishing a work of fiction which uses Harry Potter as a skeleton but taking the plot and facts within Ms. Rowling’s work and publishing them in a reorganized fashion. Part of the reason for the existence of copyright laws is to make sure that people continue to create new works of fiction rather then simply recycling old ideas. As to the issue of other companion books versus the proposed Lexicon, the companion books that have been published in the past have had a commentary aspect which the Lexicon lacks. This is the reason publication is being blocked on the Lexicon while others in the past have not.</p>
