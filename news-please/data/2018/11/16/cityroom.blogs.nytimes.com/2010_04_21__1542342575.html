<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thousands of city parents have been anxiously checking their mailboxes since Monday to see whether their four- and five-year-olds have qualified for the city&#8217;s sought-after gifted and talented programs.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Department of Education said the letters were mailed on Friday, but it appears many parents have not gotten their letters yet. Normally, mail from within the city arrives within two or three business days.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been joking with parents that maybe they were mailed from London, and they will come in with volcanic ash on them,&#8221; said <a href="//www.schoolsearchnyc.com/">Robin Aronow,</a> an educational consultant who helps parents get their children into selective schools.<br />
<span id="more-161905"></span><br />
Children took a standardized test known as the Olsat to qualify for the gifted programs. They must score in the 90th percentile to get into programs in their school district, and in the 97th percentile to qualify for the citywide programs, though in reality, there are generally only enough citywide spots for higher-scoring students.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">An online system has been set up for parents to check their scores and review their child&#8217;s results, but some parents were still awaiting their personal identification number to access the system, which is also in the mail. Others who had PINs found they didn&#8217;t work until this morning.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Some parents registered with the city&#8217;s <a href="https://prod.semsnycdoe.com/parentsite/">online enrollment system</a> have received e-mail messages &#8212; or two conflicting e-mail messages &#8212; letting them know their results. Other parents have had success calling the student enrollment hot line at 718-935-2009.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a bit of a mess,&#8221; said Bige Doruk, whose organization, Bright Kids NYC, tutored some 200 children before the test.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">For parents stuck on public kindergarten waitlists for popular schools, the delay was even more stressful. (To gauge the anxiety level, check out the <a href="//insideschools.org/blog/?url=//insideschools.org/blog/2010/04/16/gt-letters-going-out-today/">250+ comments</a> from parents on the popular blog insideschools.org)</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Parents trying to get into Public School 290 on the Upper East Side, where 103 kindergartners are on the waitlist and 92 children were admitted, plan to confront education officials at a public meeting at 6 p.m. on Wednesday at the Wagner Middle School on East 76th Street, according to a notice sent out by parents.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;The crisis has worsened with the failure of the D.O.E. to release gifted and talented test scores in time for parents to book tours of schools for which they qualify,&#8221; the notice said.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In other admissions news, after delaying a release of the information for weeks, the city said Wednesday that 6,694 eighth graders, or roughly  eight percent, were not matched to any high school in the first round of high school admissions. Last year, 7,455 students, or roughly seven percent, didn&#8217;t get initial admissions offers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The students have been entered into a supplementary admissions round, and must select a school from among those with open seats by April 29. Some top high schools, including Bard and Millennium in Manhattan and Leon M. Goldstein in Brooklyn, have a number of open seats but are not included in the supplementary round; education officials said children who had ranked those schools should appeal for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A total of 80,412 eighth-grade students applied for high school admission this year, and 77 percent received one of their top three choices, officials said. Students were able to list up to 12 choices on their admissions forms.</p>

			<p>We got three separate e-mails from the DOE over three days&#8211;none of which contained an actual score or a PIN to access the score online.  Still waiting on the snail mail letter.  Glad we got a seat in our decent regular neighborhood kindergarten, I&#8217;d be anxious if I were one of my dozens of neighbors who are waitlisted and hoping for G&#038;T qualification to get their child into a school somewhere.</p>

			<p>I hope the city knows more about gifted education now than when our kids were entering elementary schools in the 90&#8217;s. The testing and teaching methods employed were haphazard. Look at the race/income breakdowns and you will mostly find this is still a pretty package of segregation.</p>
<p>After watching my kids go through the full progression of public schools. gifted and &#8220;regular&#8221;, you learn that a good teacher is a good teacher and you can find them in either flavor.</p>
<p>As our pediatrician said once, &#8220;Normal intelligence is the most dreaded affliction in New York..&#8221;</p>

			<p>Wonder what happens if you get a letter and find out your kid is &#8216;average&#8217; &#8212; i.e. not gifted. What a blow to the NY&#8217;er parental ego that will be. The idea of coaching a 4 year old and having them take a standardized test to assess &#8216;giftedness&#8217; is crazy. 4 year olds are supposed to be happy and playful and to eat snot. They&#8217;re not supposed to sit through hours of coaching so that they can score high on a test. There are so many things wrong with this whole thing on so many levels. But the buck stops with the parents, who expose their tots to this crazy rat race of an educational system. How about this: &#8220;Your kid will be fine, will get a good education, and will be a rocket scientist, even if he doesn&#8217;t get into the most prestigious kindergarten in the city. Stop drinking the KoolAid.&#8221;</p>

			<p>#3, easy enough to say your kid will be fine &#8211; you&#8217;re not on a waitlist without a school and facing poorer alternatives than your zoned school. Some people were counting on G&#038;T, otherwise they will be randomly placed into a school of the DOEs choosing</p>

			<p>My  5 year old kid got a great score, and so did his very best friend. That&#8217;s the good news. The bad news is there is no citywide talented &#038; gifted program in the Bronx. Why? This is the very same borough that is home to several top colleges and independent schools like Horace Mann, Fieldston, riverdale country and Fordham Prep.</p>

			<p>I wonder how many 9th graders trying to get into another high school (for 10th grade) didn&#8217;t get into any high school?  No one, including the NY Times ever discussed that.  I ask because my daughter as a 9th grader went through the whole process, auditioned and did everything possible and yet still didn&#8217;t get into any of the 12 schools she applied to.  I wonder if she can appeal and if so, how do you even do that?  Oh well, off to the supplemental &#8220;draft&#8221; tomorrow.</p>

			<p>You people are sick !  Coaching 4 and 5 year olds for a test to be a &#8220;talented and gifted&#8221; and paying a fee for it ?  How about paying a coach to teach your kids respect for their friends and neighbors,  compassion for those less forutnate and  the common decency to offer up their seat on a bus to an elderly or diabled rider &#8212; nah, don&#8217;t worry about that; continue to lie to your friends about the thousands you spent to prepare your kids for these silly tests and to what lengths you went to make sure that your kid scores higher than your best friends&#8217; kid.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s so easy for people to blame the parents for perpetuating the system. It&#8217;s the city that created this outrageous system of testing four year olds with standardized tests.  The parents are just trying (admittedly some trying way too hard and obnoxiously) to get their kids in to the best possible school.</p>
<p>I feel badly for the kids that are truly gifted that don&#8217;t get to go to these schools b/c the city is too cheap to do a real assessment of their intelligence or because the city refuses to provide a decent education to all kids in the city</p>

			<p>#9 &#8211; Could you sound more judgemental?  I have a 5 year old who tested 99% last year and is now in a citywide program.  We didn&#8217;t coach her or pay a fee to a consultant.  We teach her to respect others and show empathy and kindness to all.  It just turns out she did well on the test, giving us one more option to consider (as well as our local zoned school of  PS 321).  Not every g&#038;t parent is stressed or crazed about the scores or drilling their kid.  Some kids just need other options and NYC offers that.  We saw a viable option in g&#038;t, pursued it and made a decision.  Once you take the heavy chip off your shoulder, you can bite me.</p>

			<p>#9- My daughter can read and write as well as any 1st or 2nd grader but she is only 6 years and in kindergarten.  When she was given homework for the week she completed it within 2 days.  She did not feel challenged by the level of work she was getting.  </p>
<p>As her mom, I feel it&#8217;s my responsibility that she is learning to the best of her ability.  I had her tested in January and she scored at the 98%.  I was not pushy and frankly would have been happy to learn that she wasn&#8217;t gifted but now that I found out that she is, I can put her in a school/class where they can advance her natural gifts.</p>
<p>While I agree with you that there are some parents who are what you described, the many of us are just trying to do what is in the best interest of our children.</p>

			<p>why the presumption of coaching?  because the nyt reported that it exists, it must be done everywhere by everyone?  </p>
<p>i was hesitant to even have my son do the test, but after some nudging from his teacher, i signed him up.  i didn&#8217;t tell him it was a test, or that how he did could have consequences for where he&#8217;d go to school.  a friend of mine went through the practice test given to us by his school (maybe 20 questions?) with him, just once, so he&#8217;d be familiar with the layout of the test.  as far as he knew this activity was no different from any other pre-K activity.  </p>
<p>much to my amazement, he tested into the 98th percentile, which means he has a chance (though a very slight chance) of going to the one city-wide G+T school in brooklyn.  i just went to see it today and what i LIKE about it is that it is very PLAY and INQUIRY based (no drilling kids on facts, homework optional, encouraging the kids&#8217; curiosity to help them learn&#8230;. </p>
<p>luckily we are zoned for a good school and i&#8217;m hopeful that he&#8217;ll do well wherever he goes.  but for parents in zones where the local school is awful, or where they don&#8217;t even have room for all the kindergarteners, i can understand why this is a super stressful situation!</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s pretty clear that #3 (&#8220;as&#8221;) and #9 are not from NYC and just make assumptions based on limited information.  Just because SOME parents have their kids coached, does not mean all parents do it.</p>
<p>My daughter only did the practice test.  She thought it was a game and she wanted to do more.  I didn&#8217;t even think she would do well because I was told that she was upset for missing art class when the test was administered.  (She&#8217;s in K right now.)</p>
<p>But she did great.  And now we&#8217;re touring various G&#038;T programs.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a stressful situation because you just want to give your kid the best.  Last year, we were on the waitlist for one of the better public schools and I had her take the test to give us some options for first grade.  But I&#8217;m actually happy with the school she&#8217;s in now and taking her out of her current school may not be the best decision for her.</p>
<p>If drinking the Koolaid means that I care about making the best decision for my daughter so that she&#8217;s happy and challenged at school, then, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m drinking it.  But I&#8217;d advise people like #3 and #9 to stop making such judgmental comments as it only makes them look that much more ignorant.  And #9&#8217;s comment about teaching kids to respect others is simply ironic.</p>
