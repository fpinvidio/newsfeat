As its general manager, he runs the dining room, tries to accommodate unexpected guests and walks the floor, ensuring each night’s 250 patrons leave sated. Ever wonder how people nab hard-to-come-by tables? (Is it by bribes, threats or just conscientious planning?) Or how the bar keeps over-served celebrities in check? Anything else?\nSubmit your questions for Mr. Tascarella in the comments below. We’ll pass along the best, with some of our own, and publish the answers next weekend.", "url": "https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/questions-for-the-nomads-general-manager/"}
