		<div class="entry-content"><p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><span style="color:#8c2626;">Updated, 2:38 p.m. |</span> The defense presented closing arguments in the <a href="//topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/sean_bell/index.html">Sean Bell</a> trial Monday morning with a combination of science and theatrics to make their case that the three detectives charged in Mr. Bell’s shooting were justified in pulling their triggers.<br />
<span id="more-2574"></span><br />
The closing arguments of the three defense attorneys lasted about four hours, with prosecutors beginning their summation after the lunch break. The closing arguments were directed to an audience of one, Justice Arthur J. Cooperman, who is hearing the case without a jury and is expected to announce a verdict April 25.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The most startling of the arguments came from Anthony L. Ricco, who represents Detective Gescard F. Isnora, the undercover detective who fired the first shot that morning, Nov. 25, 2006. His wide-ranging argument included quoting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and attacks on the Rev. Al Sharpton’s organization, which has supported Mr. Bell’s family and the men wounded in the shooting. He also suggested that the shooting began because the detective was a black man with a gun, but quoting a witness describing Detective Isnora, he used a racial slur, repeating it several times during his more than hour-long argument.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Apparently referring to Mr. Sharpton, who was in the courtroom briefly Monday and left before Mr. Ricco began speaking, he said, “Somebody wanted this case to come out and fit a script. They know who they are.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“They turn their back on people like Gescard Isnora,” he said, mentioning “fancy radio shows” and “a network.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Detective Isnora was “marginalized, discounted and run over like a dog,” Mr. Ricco said. In using the racial slur, he quoted Trent Benefield, who was wounded in the shooting and who used the slur in a tape-recorded interview with detectives that morning, saying that after men drove by in a car, “another whole different” person approached the car with a gun.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He appeared to try to extend an olive branch to Mr. Bell’s parents, who have listened to him criticize their son’s behavior that morning many times over the seven weeks of trial.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“No parent should have to go through what Sean Bell’s parents have gone through,” he said. “That is no courtroom tactic. That’s one parent to another.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He called his client a “hero.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;I came here to represent a very fine young man,&#8221; Mr. Ricco said, asking his client to stand. &#8220;That is Detective Gescard Isnora. He&#8217;s a decent, dignified, graceful young man. And he did his job the best he could. He put himself between harm&#8217;s way and people in the streets all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Ricco, who is black, made some personal remarks, noting that people had tried to intimidate him, <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/nyregion/31ricco.html">arguing that he should not take the case</a>. Mr. Ricco spoke about young black men who have been denied legal representation because lawyers were too afraid to get involved. &#8220;I face this kind of nonsense all over the country,&#8221; Mr. Ricco said. &#8220;It only makes me a better lawyer.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Part of Mr. Ricco&#8217;s closing argument focused on Jean Nelson, a friend of Mr. Bell&#8217;s. Mr.  Nelson testified that he heard Mr. Bell tell Fabio Coicou, a man he was arguing with, “Yeah, we’ll take that gun from you.” (Detective Isnora did not say he heard that and Mr. Coicou said no one was arguing about anything.)  Mr. Ricco said that Mr. Nelson was the only one of Mr. Bell&#8217;s friends to testify truthfully.  &#8220;He broke the ranks to tell the truth,&#8221; Mr. Ricco said. &#8220;A lot of people rolled eyes and sucked teeth when he was on the witness stand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Ricco described his client as a hard-working and brave officer who has been shunned by other blacks. &#8220;What did Gescard Isnora do so that the whole community turns their back on him?&#8221; Mr. Ricco said. &#8220;He&#8217;s putting his life on the line every day for my kids, for your kids, for everybody else&#8217;s kids.&#8221; Mr. Ricco repeated Detective Isnora&#8217;s claim that he had identified himself as a police officer and yelled commands before opening fire. &#8220;There was no proof to the contrary,&#8221; Mr. Ricco asserted.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">By contrast, an attorney for Detective Michael Oliver, James J. Culleton, focused his arguments on ballistics evidence and the testimony of crime scene analysts who said the evidence suggested the shooting began only after Mr. Bell had twice rammed his car into an unmarked police van. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Earlier in the morning, Paul P. Martin, the lawyer for Detective Marc Cooper, who is charged with reckless endangerment, the least serious of the charges against the officers, gave  animated and emotional remarks for about an hour.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Martin said Detective Cooper was justified in firing four shots at Mr. Bell’s car because he thought he himself was under fire, even though he did not see anyone shooting and he described his position as unbalanced.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“This isn’t TV and it isn’t &#8216;Miami Vice&#8217; and they’re not taught to shoot guns out of people’s hands,” he said. He said convicting Detective Cooper of reckless endangerment would send the wrong message to all police officers.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“What they’re saying is, ‘Don’t take your gun out until you go out in the country,’” he said. “‘Detective Cooper, wait until you are more balanced.’ Next time, you’re dead. That’s what they’re asking for.”  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Martin said he was dismayed at the weakness of the prosecution&#8217;s case.  &#8220;I really started to question this system &#8212; the justice system, which I&#8217;ve depended on, relied on,&#8221; Mr. Martin said.  &#8220;I&#8217;ve questioned how the prosecution could come before you and say that Detective Marc Cooper was guilty of anything.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Detective Cooper is charged with reckless endangerment for firing a round that struck an elevated AirTrain terminal with several people inside, but Mr. Martin said it was not even clear whether the detective&#8217;s bullet in fact hit the train.  Mr. Martin argued that the detective had a target in mind when he fired and acted reasonably and with police protocols. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Martin also questioned why two other police officers who were present and opened fire, Detective Paul Headley and Officer Michael Carey, were not charged.  &#8220;He responded in a manner that a New York City police officer should,&#8221; Mr. Martin said of his client. &#8220;He was not the catalyst. He was not the starter.&#8221; </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Martin also caused a brief stir when he essentially blamed the death of Mr. Bell on Mr. Bell&#8217;s friend Joseph Guzman. One of the detectives on trial, Gescard F. Isnora, has said he overheard Mr. Guzman say, “Get my gun,” which led to the shooting. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#8220;He&#8217;s the reason why we&#8217;re here today,&#8221; Mr. Martin said of Mr. Guzman, whom he described as thuggish. At that point, Mr. Guzman&#8217;s wife, Ebony, stormed out of the courtroom.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Martin also suggested that a conviction would put police officers in danger. &#8220;Think about the precedent that the district attorney&#8217;s office is trying to set,&#8221; Mr. Martin said, arguing that a conviction would mean police officers should not reach for their guns until they are fired upon.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Sharpton, who has been working with Mr. Bell&#8217;s family and closely monitored the case, left the courtroom after Mr. Martin made his closing argument and before Ricco began his remarks.  </p>

			<p>One thing is for sure.  The Rev. Al Sharpton will be screaming about racism unless all 3 police officers are found guilty.  And though I cannot be sure, I am willing to bet he did not pay attention to any of the facts uncovered at trial.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve been following this case but may have missed some testimony.  The reports have said many times that the police officers shouted their identity.  Did any of them show a badge?  Shouting that you&#8217;re police doesn&#8217;t make you police.  Second, 50 rounds requires some special explanation, I&#8217;ve seen none.</p>

			<p>The Post declared today the NYPD is putting 1k more boys in blue on the streets for when the verdict is rendered next week. That&#8217;s either ironically stupid or stupidly ironic, I have yet to figure out which is worse.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also not sure of the game plan: there&#8217;s a frivolity or flippancy involved when you use recruits and JV cops to handle riot control.  </p>
<p>One also has to wonder about the assumption that a specific ethnic group WILL riot and &#8220;green light&#8221; that said expectation gives to such violence.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a black man, so I cannot speak for the ghost of MLK, Jr., but I would assume if he was truly as logical as he was passionate, he would say (especially after the King Riots in LA) to his people en masse: think before you act and consider ridding the city-weeds at the root (i.e. voting out the brass and judges and city council members who condone such behavior within the NYPD).</p>
<p>Where will Rev. Al and Jesse and every other leader of color be on the EVE of the verdict&#8217;s reading.  Will they call for protests and pre-ordained boycotts or will they do the RIGHT thing and plead to their own to use reason and logic and maturity?  </p>
<p>My money is not on the latter, sad to say.  What a joyous occasion for me and my &#8216;assumed&#8217; prejudices to be wrong, but I am a student of history and patterns and I am NOT holding my breath.</p>

			<p>People don&#8217;t ubnderstand the pain they cause until it is inflicted upon them. the police officers in the Sean Bell shooting were not justified, how could they be? At what point did they realize that no one was shooting back? What ever happened to their lie about a fourth man runnig with a gun?</p>

			<p>At its worst this was a very sloppy operation overseen by incompetents.  It was not a crime.  The families of those injured and killed should and will receive ample compensation.  But this was not a crime.  In a neighborhood overrun by guns and thuggery, things like this happen.  It&#8217;s sad but true.  This a violent, gun loving, attutitude driven, gangster environment.  That&#8217;s what needs to change.  And perhaps in the future when young men need to go out until dawn the night before their wedding they will stay away from the seediest of places in dangerous neighborhoods.  There was no place else in the entire city where these guys can go to celebrate?  They had to go to this awful place?  It&#8217;s a dump.  And if they couldn&#8217;t afford the more expensive strip clubs, and I admit I do not see the great attraction to these clubs, it was that important to go see worn out seedy women at this particular club?  This strip club party culture is tied to the gun loving violent daily lfe in these communities.  Stay away from trouble and trouble won&#8217;t find you.<br />
These cops should be suspended and busted in rank and the whole operation looked into so perhaps tragic mistakes like this won&#8217;t happen again.  Though from what I see on both sides that is unlikely.</p>

			<p>This is an acquittal.  Remember folks, the operative issue in any criminal case is the existence of reasonable doubt.  At least according to the NyTimes coverage, Isnora was clearly a credible witness who testified to, at most, a mistaken, but reasonable, perception that Guzmnan had a gun and was reaching for it.  Even if Guzman did not actually have a gun, it is not disputed that Bell was driving at Isnora, either to run over him or get away.  In Isnora&#8217;s mind, Bell was trying to kill him with the car, while Guzman was reaching for a gun.  </p>
<p>In order for the judge to find the officers guilty, he has to find Isnora to be a complete liar.  All of isnora&#8217;s testimony has been corroborated by at least one other witness, whom the judge would also have to brand as liars to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  </p>
<p>An acquittal is the only just result in this case &#8212; one that never should have been brought in the first place.  We are all sorry for the Bell family, but this was a mistake that will be remedied by the civil system, to the extent any remedy is possible.  Criminal charges are for intentional or reckless conduct, and this was neither.</p>

			<p>To back up Robert R.&#8217;s excellent point at #9, I just wanted to mention that this was one catastrophic accident in which cops shot one man to death and injured others.  The guy who fired 31 shots was clearly a loose cannon and should do desk duty from here on in or be fired, the others less culpable.  But it was a sloppy operation not a planned murder.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in neighborhoods just like this one all around the city, there are several hundred people shot dead every year on purpose by criminal civilians.  Maybe that should be the focus of so-called leaders like Al Sharpton.  Young black men do not have to worry so much about being shot by cops, as being shot by crooks, since it&#8217;s around 500 times more likely.</p>
<p>This also points up how these cops had every reasonable expectation that a rowdy drunk group of men leaving a shady strip club and hopping in their car were armed, since a large percentage of similar drunk rowdy men in the area would be.  I hope for an acquittal followed by a couple of firings, demotions, and assignments to desk jobs.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t be simplistic.  Being in a bad neighborhood doesn&#8217;t automatically get you shot. But sometimes events come together where these mistakes happen. This was such a night.  A place known for prostitution, drugs and violence, cops staking it out, people challenging each other to a fight, threats of having a gun, drunkedness, inept cops.  Add it all up.  And if you have to make a choice, don&#8217;t go into a bad neighborhood looking for sleazy  fun.  Because just as easily a mugger or gnag banger can stick a gun in your face.  Wise up.</p>

			<p>Remember, the defense attorneys have potrayed this incident as a bunch of drunks behind the wheel of car versus the cops trying to preserve &#8220;law and order&#8221;.  </p>
<p>What we do not know and what we will never know is whether the cops in question were drunk themselves that night.  Since NYPD, did not give breathalizer tests, urine tests and/or blood tests, to the accused officers that day, we do not know whether the &#8220;righteous, upstanding, dignified&#8221; Detective Isnora that Attorney Riccio so proclaims was stoned out of his mind that night, which may explain his 31 shots.</p>
<p>I was on a flight to Arizona recently, and was sitting next to a former police officer.  He said he retired because the force was full of cops. I asked him what the difference was. He explained to me that each letter of the word &#8220;cop&#8221;, was an acronym for the words: Corrupt Obnoxious Punks.  </p>
<p>NYPD &#8220;finest&#8221; will get off again.</p>

			<p>The officers should all be found innocent and the bell family should receive nothing. The justice system is a sham when people can terrorize the community and then turn around and blame the police when they are confronted.</p>

			<p>Remember that intent is the key element in this case. These detectives never went to work that night with the intent to have anyone get hurt or much worse killed. Intent to commit a crime must be proven in order to charge someone criminally. There was no criminal intent, therefore no crime.</p>

			<p>Oh yes and for those who think that in the absence of supposed criminal intent (which Oliver&#8217;s testimony seems to have) we find that manslaughter, which they are charged with is:</p>
<p>The cases of manslaughter may be classed as follows those which take place in consequence of: 1. Provocation. 2. Mutual combat. 3. Resistance to public officers, etc. 4. Killing in the prosecution of an unlawful or wanton act. 5. Killing in the prosecution of a lawful act, improperly performed, or performed without lawful authority. </p>
<p>You&#8217;ll note definition 5, which applies here. The officers may have had a lawful reason to go after bell and co, but since it was clear, by the testimony of  Oliver, Isnora and Napoli, that the lawful actions were improperly performed at a minimum.</p>

			<p>Police the world over (and the U.S. is no exception) have the right to use deadly violence, which is unfortunately over-interpreted with deadly and unjust results. We give them a kind of power which requires almost god-like wisdom, which, of course, they don&#8217;t have. If a mere citizen were afraid of being run down by a driver, the response would be to get out of the way. If a drunk hits our car, we have no right to indulge in deadly force.  Neither should the police have such a right. If they can get out of the way, that should be their response, too.  An out of control car can be stopped in other ways.<br />
Why was the car out of control? because the driver believed (with good reason, clearly) that his life was threatened. He panicked. Who, threatened by a screaming man pointing a gun at him, would behave differently? Escape or die. The situation was threatening but ill-defined. I suggest that if the cops had been in uniform, Bell et al&#8217;s behavior would have been different.  My solution: Cops in civilian gear engage in specific undercover projects, not regular law enforcement.  Better yet &#8211; no uniform, no weapons.<br />
I would like to see the accused cops do substantial jail time.</p>

			<p>Struck by a sudden bout of insomnia, I am also struck by comments 13, 15, 16, 19, and 22.  All are gone now, lost to the ether.  Seems there are a lot of strong feelings about this case, which is funny if you think about it.</p>
<p>Between 400 and 1000 murders occur in New York City every year, roughly, during my lifetime at any rate.  Why is this killing (I wouldn&#8217;t call it murder) so important and so emotionally provoking?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to request that all those whose comments got yanked think things over a bit.  You didn&#8217;t know Mr. Bell or anyone else involved (in all likelihood).  Turns out I&#8217;ve met the transit cop who ducked when the train got hit by a stray bullet (Officer Cea), so I&#8217;ve probably got the most personal connection of all us bloggin about it.</p>
<p>You certainly weren&#8217;t there and have no cause for postulations like those of &#8220;Gunther Badoo&#8221; (&#8220;If they can get out of the way&#8221;, could he?; &#8220;threatened by a screaming man pointing a gun at him&#8221;, was his gun drawn before the gas pedal was floored?).</p>
<p>Didya see the movie Copland?  Probably Stallone&#8217;s best acting ever, and the scene I&#8217;m thinking about is Mike Rappaport on the bridge.  Spoiler here, but he winds up shooting a guy who pointed a Club &#8482; at him, which he assumed was a gun.</p>
<p>Picture that scene again&#8230; did &#8216;Supercop&#8217; (Rappaport) intend to murder that guy?</p>
<p>Try to see this from the perspective of a bored, tired cop on an incredibly skanky stakeout, who never fired a shot in the line of duty (none of the five had done so).  And I dunno if you&#8217;ve been hit by a car, but every time I was, I was not thinking clearly for a couple minutes afterward.</p>
<p>[The funniest one was when I was hit by a speeding VW bug, the new type, at 14th and 6th&#8230; I flew 20 feet, bounced up, skated over to the driver&#8217;s window, looked in on four shocked college kids, and said &#8220;are you guys alright?&#8221;]</p>
<p>So try to have some perspective, and definitely remember this next bit:</p>
<p>NONE of what you think, or write on this blog, or feel about this case, will change its outcome in the slightest.  So relax a bit and don&#8217;t take it so much to heart.  If you want to go around being furious, there are thousands of larger problems in the world to be furious about.</p>
<p>Lastly to the family and friends of Mr. Bell, if you&#8217;re reading this, sorry for being such a jerk about this case myself, and I hope you can recover well from your loss.  I do count on the fact that you&#8217;ll run into Sean again in some way some time, so I&#8217;m more cavalier about death than most, hence the flippancy.</p>
