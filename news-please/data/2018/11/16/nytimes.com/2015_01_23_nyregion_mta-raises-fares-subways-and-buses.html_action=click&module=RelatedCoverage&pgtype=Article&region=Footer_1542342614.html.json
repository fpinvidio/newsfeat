The previous increase, in 2013, raised the base fare to $2.50, from $2.25.\nThe subway system has recently seen record use, with more than six million riders on some days, but the authority is facing questions over how to pay for long-term improvements to its infrastructure. The agency’s proposal for a $32 billion, five-year capital plan has a $15 billion funding shortfall, and the board is seeking contributions from the state and the city.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/nyregion/mta-raises-fares-subways-and-buses.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
