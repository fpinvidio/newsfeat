A word that evoked only Parisian gadabouts five years ago is cropping up on menus at bars across the country, including the recently opened Long Island Bar in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where the co-owner Toby Cecchini sells rafts of them. Just two years ago, Mr. Cecchini lamented in T: The New York Times Style Magazine, that this simple mix of whiskey (usually bourbon), sweet vermouth and Campari had not “found wider fame in the current fast-moving mixology environment.”\nHe can take down the black crepe. The Boulevardier is on the menu at the new Midtown bar Hudson Malone; at Splitty in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn; and at Minetta Tavern and Maysville in Manhattan. Alder, Wylie Dufresne’s restaurant in the East Village, has a version with smoked vermouth called the Burnt Reynolds. Lincoln Ristorante on the Upper West Side fielded enough requests for the drink that it recently decided to start barrel-aging a house version. (A bottled, barrel-aged Boulevardier was introduced last year by the Utah distiller High West.)", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/dining/the-boulevardier-is-back-on-the-menu.html"}
