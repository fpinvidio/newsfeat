Kim Davis, the clerk in Rowan County, about 60 miles east of Lexington, has refused to issue any marriage licenses since the justicesâ€™ June decision, saying that her Christian faith bars her from authorizing same-sex marriages.\nIn July, she was sued by four couples who were turned away after the ruling in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges, in which the Supreme Court held that bans on same-sex marriage violated the due process clause of the Constitution and the equal protection clause in the 14th Amendment.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/27/us/court-rules-clerk-must-issue-licenses-for-same-sex-marriages.html"}
