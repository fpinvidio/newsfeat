A big part of the plan involved finding a weekend house in the Hamptons where he could spend some serious time not only with his soon-to-be husband, Ryan James Brandau, after a longtime cross-country relationship, but also with his parents, who live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n“Call it my guilt of abandoning the East Coast for a decade,” said Mr. Ferguson, 34, who runs Res Facta, a creative agency for tech start-ups, and helped create Tech for Campaigns, an organization focused on helping Democratic political campaigns.\nMr. Brandau, 37, a conductor, was just as keen. “Both Ian’s dad and I love to cook,” he said. “We have very functional kitchens in the city, but not one where we can cook as a team.”\nImage “We had never owned a house before and were somewhat intimidated by what that entailed: the machines, the roof, the systems,” said Ian Ferguson, left, at home with Ryan James Brandau.
