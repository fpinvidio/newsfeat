While that has been true for decades, it is rarely highlighted in American statements.\n“Threatening a missile-capable warhead with a successful third nuclear test gives the United States, South Korea and Japan good reason to step up their regional ballistic missile defense capabilities,” said Siegfried S. Hecker, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and co-director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University. “That should give the Chinese government some pause.”\nThe United States faces its own geopolitical calculations. Some experts say it needs to keep up the tough talk, even if it understands that its efforts at the Security Council may not do much to limit the North’s capabilities. Even the strongest sanctions and increasing isolation have not caused the North to back off its nuclear program, which the leadership sees as both a deterrent to possible American aggression, and which gives the impoverished country’s governing elite a success it can show its suffering people.\nNow experts say the North may be simply trying to wait the United States out, hoping it will eventually recognize its program as it did Pakistan’s. But experts say Mr. Obama cannot recognize North Korea as the nuclear state it increasingly is without giving signals to Iran — which the West believes is pursuing a nuclear weapon despite its denials — that it could try the same path.\nAs the world’s powers struggle to refine their policies, North Korea continues to make technological advances. A long-range rocket test in December has been judged by outside experts to have been a success after many failures.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-test.html?module=inline"}
