He’s a complete, romantic dancing actor, or acting dancer. Like such hallowed predecessors as Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, he’s as expressive with his twirls and jetés as he is with his face and voice, bringing balletic wonder to ordinary rituals of love and courtship.\nUnfortunately, there are few shows around these days to provide a worthy showcase for the distinctive talents of Mr. Yazbeck, who received a Tony nomination as a pirouetting sailor (played by Kelly on screen) in the delightful 2014 Broadway revival of “On the Town.”\nFans awaiting another glimpse of Mr. Yazbeck thinking — and feeling — on his feet should therefore be at least a little grateful for “The Beast in the Jungle,” the new dance play that opened on Wednesday night at the Vineyard Theater Off Broadway. Fans of Henry James, on the other hand, should stay away.\nNow how, you may ask, did we get from Gene Kelly to Henry James? Well, this production — which features an A-Team of creative talent, starting with the director and choreographer Susan Stroman (“Contact,” “The Producers”) and composer John Kander (“Cabaret,” “Chicago”) — is based on one of James’s greatest long short stories (or, if you prefer, novellas).", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/theater/review-beast-in-the-jungle-vineyard-theater.html"}
