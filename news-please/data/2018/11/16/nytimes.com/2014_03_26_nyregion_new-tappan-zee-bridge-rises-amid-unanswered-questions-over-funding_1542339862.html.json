Madison Jr., the authority’s executive director, said in an interview.\nBut more than a few government officials, including members of the State Legislature and transportation finance experts, fear that increases in what is now a $5 round-trip toll may be too steep for daily commuters and thus politically untenable.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/nyregion/new-tappan-zee-bridge-rises-amid-unanswered-questions-over-funding.html"}
