The final report is due to be handed to General Allen in the second half of March. Any legal action will be pursued under United States laws and regulations, not Afghan laws, a NATO legal official who asked for anonymity because the investigation was continuing said Wednesday.\nThe brigadier general in charge of the investigation has been at the Detention Facility in Parwan and the Bagram Air Base since Feb. 22, interviewing the people involved and inspecting the evidence, and was in the process of returning to the capital, Kabul.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe formal investigation overlaps with a joint inquiry that also includes three senior Afghan security officials from the Afghan Army, the National Directorate of Security and the Interior Ministry, who have been at Parwan and Bagram with the American brigadier general.\nThis joint inquiry will lead to a joint report that will be passed to General Allen for review, and that could then be released publicly as early as the next three or four days.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One group of incidents occurred at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and the other in Iraq, when at least one soldier used a Koran for target practice.\nAt Guantánamo Bay, there were accusations — later deemed untrue by the military — that soldiers had flushed a Koran down the toilet. The final military investigation concluded, however, that there had been five instances of the mishandling of the Koran by guards and an interrogator over the course of a number of years, and two soldiers were punished.\nGeneral Allen can choose to act on the recommendations of the AR15-6 investigation, ignore them or combine them with other steps, a military officer said in a background briefing.\nAmong the available punishments are everything from demotions and discharge from the military to imprisonment.\n“General Allen takes this process extremely seriously,” said an legal official with the NATO-led coalition. “He can accept the recommendations, and he can make his own recommendations.”\nWhile one possible result of the investigation is a court-martial, and even imprisonment, officials say that would be an extreme outcome. There are many more minor forms of punishment — yet even those far lighter penalties would be taken seriously by people in the military chain of command.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMore than 30 Afghans have died in the violence that followed the Koran burning, and there have been at least three assaults on American military personnel since thousands of Afghans took to the streets to protest.\nThe assaults on Americans took place in the Khogyani district of Nangarhar Province when a man in an Afghan Army uniform shot and killed two American soldiers; in Kunduz Province, where a grenade thrown by protesters near a base wounded at least six American service members; and in Kabul where two American military officers were shot in the head by an Afghan assailant who entered a secure area of the Interior Ministry where the two were working.\nThe third, purely Afghan investigation is by a task force that includes members of Afghanistan’s Ulema Council and some Parliament members. The Ulema is the pre-eminent religious authority in the country and is made up of scholarly mullahs.\nIn violence around the country on Wednesday, a suicide bomber drove a vehicle into a convoy of a NATO provincial reconstruction team in Lashkar Gah in Helmand Province in the south, wounding at least six people, while a car bomb outside a bank in Takhar Province in northern Afghanistan wounded 12 people, government and police officials said.\nSeparately, an explosion in the Nawa district of Helmand Province on Monday night in the home of a man suspected of being associated with the Taliban killed the man’s wife and six children, a police official confirmed Wednesday. The official said investigators were trying to determine whether the home was used for manufacturing bombs.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/world/asia/koran-burning-in-afghanistan-prompts-3-parallel-inquiries.html?_r=1&ref=koran"}
