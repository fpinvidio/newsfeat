If possible, soak chiles overnight in plenty of cold water. If time is short, cover chiles with boiling water and soak for 20 minutes. Drain and discard soaking liquid.\n2. If using peppercorns, coarsely grind in a mortar or spice grinder.\n3. In a blender or mortar, combine all the ingredients with 2 tablespoons of water and grind until smooth (the seeds of the chiles will remain whole). The finished sauce should be as thick as ketchup; thin with water as needed.\nYield: About 3/4 cup.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/dining/sepen-or-tibetan-hot-sauce-recipe.html"}
