Teeth are pressed into service, in the old animal way. Everything requires a little gnawing, and is worth it.\nOnce a year, during the annual Momo Crawl, this block of 37th Road is thronged by pilgrims in search of New York’s finest momos, dumplings with furrows like the shoulders of mountains. Last fall, Nepali Bhanchha Ghar won Best Momo in Town, as attested by the trophy on the kitchen wall: a yak-hide belt adorned with a gold-painted momo and a stone from Mount Everest, known as Sagarmatha in Nepali and as Jomolungma by the Sherpas who live in its shadow.\nMomos are available steamed and fried, but the winning version was jhol momo, dumplings resting in a chutney of broken-down tomatoes, sesame seeds and chicken broth. It’s so loose and liquidy that it could qualify as soup. The dumplings themselves come generously packed with beef or chicken, their juices pent up.\nThey’re delicious — but so are the ones next door at Potala, and upstairs at Phayul, and across the street at the Amdo Kitchen truck. There are momos throughout the neighborhood, each with folds and flavors unique to its maker. In this city of plenty, how will I ever try them all?", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/dining/nepali-bhanchha-ghar-review.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
