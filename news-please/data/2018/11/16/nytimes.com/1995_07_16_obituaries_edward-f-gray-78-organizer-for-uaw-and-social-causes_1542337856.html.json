Gray, a former union official who began his career recruiting factory workers in New Jersey and ended it by organizing the elderly in New York, died on Thursday at the Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. He was 78.\nThe cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Lois.\nIt may have been his youthful experiences as a sharecropper and migrant farm worker in the Depression or simply something in his blood, but somehow, early in his life, Mr. Gray developed an acute and wide-ranging sense of social justice.\nIn his years as a United Auto Workers official, Mr. Gray, who was first elected to the union's executive board when he was 26 and was later a regional director in New York, took a broad view of his role. He helped lead the union into the campaign against racial discrimination, was an organizer of the Labor Committee to End the War in Vietnam, and championed affordable housing for the elderly and the disabled.\nWhile serving as a U.A.W. area director in Buffalo in the late 1940's, his wife recalled yesterday, Mr. Gray became so incensed that black workers were banned from bowling leagues sponsored by the American Bowling Congress that he established a rival, integrated bowling organization that helped prompt the A.B.C. to change its policies.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMr. Gray's union career began in his 20's when he took a job at an auto parts plant in Trenton and promptly led a successful campaign to organize a U.A.W. local there. As the local's first president, he became an early and fierce supporter of Walter Reuther in the union's bitter factional wars of the 1930's and 1940's and won election to the union's executive board in 1943.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/16/obituaries/edward-f-gray-78-organizer-for-uaw-and-social-causes.html"}
