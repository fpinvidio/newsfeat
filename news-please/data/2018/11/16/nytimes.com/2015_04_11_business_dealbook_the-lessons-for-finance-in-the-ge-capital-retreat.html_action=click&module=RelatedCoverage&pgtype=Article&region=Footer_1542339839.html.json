It had $69 billion of short-term borrowings. That sum was substantially lower than before the crisis, but even that may be too high in the new regulatory environment. The Fed is preparing new rules that would mean extra constraints for companies that use a lot of wholesale funding.\n“Since the crisis, we’ve been making GE Capital smaller and safer, and it’s a really strong business,” Seth Martin, a G.E. spokesman, said. One of GE Capital’s biggest businesses is lending to medium-size companies. Mr. Martin said that activity was not particularly risky.\nOne concern raised by GE Capital’s plans is that large amounts of financial assets might be moving from regulated entities into firms that the Fed and others have little power over. The Blackstone Group, the private equity firm, is buying some of GE Capital’s assets, for instance. But if Blackstone were to grow to a certain size, it, too, could come under the Fed’s regulation as a “systemically important” institution.\nIn many ways, GE Capital is a remnant of a heady, hubristic era in the markets that gave birth to entities like Long-Term Capital Management, the giant hedge fund that had to be rescued in 1998, and Lehman Brothers. GE Capital did not implode in the same spectacular manner as those two, but its game was more or less up.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/business/dealbook/the-lessons-for-finance-in-the-ge-capital-retreat.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
