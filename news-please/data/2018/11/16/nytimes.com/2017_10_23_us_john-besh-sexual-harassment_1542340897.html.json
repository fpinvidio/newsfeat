The women said that they were subjected to inappropriate touching and comments from male employees and managers, and that, in some cases, individuals in power tried to use their positions for sex. Some of the allegations were against Mr. Besh himself.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/us/john-besh-sexual-harassment.html"}
