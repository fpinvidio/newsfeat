Fans of Irish stew will tell you the neck is the best choice. Kidney, liver, tongue and heart are delectable and mild-tasting. But the most versatile cut of all is the shoulder.\nShoulder of lamb has fat marbled throughout, which makes it great for braising and for burgers. But a shoulder is also delicious roasted medium-rare, especially a boneless shoulder, which can be stuffed with chopped garlic and herbs, or any other seasoning you desire. While the slices may not be as perfect as those from the hind leg, the flavor is extraordinary. And the price of a shoulder is considerably less than that of a prime-cut leg.\nIn Morocco, lamb is found in the form of spicy simmered tagines or a whole lamb spit-roasted for hours to make the group-friendly celebratory méchoui. But many cooks there are fond of steamed lamb. Once you taste it, you will be, too.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/dining/moroccan-lamb-shoulder-steamed-recipe.html"}
