The business-oriented company will be called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, while the PC company will be called HP Inc. and will retain the company’s current logo. The transaction is expected to be completed by October 2015, the end of HP’s fiscal year, the company said.\nIn a statement, Meg Whitman, HP’s chief executive, said the company was splitting up to “more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/business/hewlett-packard-announces-breakup-plan.html?_r=0"}
