The Kremlin agreed to allow a team of international monitors to work elsewhere in Ukraine. Fears of a further invasion had increased on Friday as Russian troops massed along Ukraine’s eastern border, and the United States issued a stern warning in response.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/world/europe/ukraine.html?module=inline"}
