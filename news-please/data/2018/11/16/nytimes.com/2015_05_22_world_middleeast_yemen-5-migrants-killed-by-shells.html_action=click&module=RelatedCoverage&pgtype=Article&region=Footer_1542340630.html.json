Parts of the border region have become a violent front in the conflict between a Saudi-led coalition and forces allied with Yemenâ€™s Houthi rebels. The Ethiopians had sought shelter near an aid center in Haradh run by the International Organization for Migration, which has helped evacuate foreigners from Yemen. In a separate attack on Thursday, at least 19 people died when airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition struck a residential neighborhood in Dhamar, south of Sana, the capital, said an official at a nearby hospital.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/22/world/middleeast/yemen-5-migrants-killed-by-shells.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
