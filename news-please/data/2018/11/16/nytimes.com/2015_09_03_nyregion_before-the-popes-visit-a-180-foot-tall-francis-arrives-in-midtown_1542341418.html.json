But creating possibly the largest hand-painted mural of Francis ever done, a project commissioned by the Diocese of Brooklyn ahead of his visit to New York at the end of September, took on spiritual significance.\n“It’s a great blessing,” he said.\nSince last Monday, from 6:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., Mr. Hecht-Nielsen and his team of three painters, armed with hoghair brushes and 80 to 100 gallons of paint, have been working to put flesh on the mural.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/nyregion/before-the-popes-visit-a-180-foot-tall-francis-arrives-in-midtown.html"}
