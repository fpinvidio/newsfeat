In the past, the White House has used the budget office numbers as a benchmark for success under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe new estimate appeared to be part of an effort by federal officials to lower public expectations, so the goal would be easier to meet and to surpass. In addition, the new number could indicate that administration officials believe it will be difficult to find and enroll many of the uninsured while retaining those who signed up in the last year.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/us/us-gives-modest-forecast-for-enrollments-under-health-law.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
