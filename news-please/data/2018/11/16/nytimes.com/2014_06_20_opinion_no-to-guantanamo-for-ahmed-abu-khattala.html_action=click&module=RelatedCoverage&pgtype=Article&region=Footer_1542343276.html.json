Since then, only one has been tried and convicted with the case upheld on appeal. That was Ahmed Ghailani, a Tanzanian national who received a life sentence for his role in the 1998 bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 223 people. Mr. Ghailani was tried in federal court in New York, and he is serving his sentence in a federal prison in the United States. His 13 comrades from the C.I.A. detention and interrogation program are still in limbo at Guantánamo, where justice for them and the families of their victims remains elusive.\nWhen word got out that Ahmed Abu Khattala, suspected of being the ringleader of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, had been captured, it was inevitable that some would demand sending him to Guantánamo. Among the Guantánamo advocates who argue that Mr. Abu Khattala should be interrogated there as an enemy combatant are Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, two individuals I worked with in 2006 when I was the chief prosecutor for the Guantánamo military commissions.\nBack then, Senators McCain and Graham stood up against those in the administration of President George W. Bush who wanted harsh tactics and rigged justice, and I have great respect for the way they swam against the political current. But they are wrong now to oppose the Obama administration’s plan to bring Mr. Abu Khattala to the United States to stand trial in a federal court.\nToo often, the public falls prey to the superficial argument that we are in a war against terrorism and that foreign terrorism suspects do not deserve the rights afforded American citizens. That seems sensible on its face, but what is it exactly that needs to be compromised in terrorism cases to ensure that the guilty face justice while also protecting our national security? What would we gain, in other words, by sending Mr. Abu Khattala to Guantánamo?", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/opinion/no-to-guantanamo-for-ahmed-abu-khattala.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
