Democrats have seized on the political fury that developed over the apparent lack of qualifications of Michael D. Brown, the director, and others in the Federal Emergency Management Agency who were called on to deal with the calamity caused by Hurricane Katrina. Day after day, Democratic lawmakers have begun aggressively challenging the credentials of people President Bush wants to place in midlevel government positions.", "filename": "2005_09_24_politics_amid-many-fights-over-qualifications-a-bush-nomination-stalls-in_1542340685.html", "image_url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "language": "en", "localpath": "/Users/federicoperezinvidio/Projects/illinois/newsfeat/news-please//data/2018/11/16/nytimes.com/2005_09_24_politics_amid-many-fights-over-qualifications-a-bush-nomination-stalls-in_1542340685.html", "title": "Amid Many Fights Over Qualifications, a Bush Nomination Stalls in the Senate", "title_page": "Amid Many Fights Over Qualifications, a Bush Nomination Stalls in the Senate - The New York Times", "title_rss": "NULL", "source_domain": "nytimes.com", "text": "The White House continued to express support for her Friday.\n\"Julie Myers is well known and respected throughout the law enforcement community, and she has a proven track record as a strong and effective manager,\" said Erin Healy, a presidential spokeswoman.\nIn addition to the questions about Ms. Myers, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan has objected to the nomination of Stewart Baker to be assistant secretary of homeland security for policy. Mr. Baker, who won committee approval despite Mr. Levin's opposition, is an accomplished technology lawyer, but he has little experience in disaster management.\nAt the same time, the Center for American Progress, a research institute for out-of-office Democratic policy experts, has questioned whether Andrew B. Maner is qualified for his position as chief financial officer of the Homeland Security Department, which has a budget of about $35 billion and more than 180,000 employees. Mr. Maner's main government experience before joining this administration was a job in the White House press office under the first President Bush.\nThe questions of credentials are not limited to homeland security. For example, the main experience of Brian D. Montgomery, who in June became assistant secretary for housing and federal housing commissioner, was performing advance work in the Bush presidential campaign of 2000 and in the current administration's first term.\nMr. Montgomery's responsibilities now include overseeing the $500 billion Federal Housing Administration insurance portfolio. His background in housing is limited to a few years as communications director of the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs.\nPeople who have studied the workings of the federal government for years say this administration is no worse than President Bill Clinton's or any other recent ones in the qualifications of political appointees.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Light, a political scientist at New York University, said, \"In every administration, there are certain people you have to find places for: people who worked on your campaign or were contributors or are well connected with other politicians.\"\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nClay Johnson III, who was head of the White House personnel office for the first three years of the current Bush administration and is now deputy budget director, said Mr. Bush's appointees had been \"superbly qualified,\" in large part because the president emphasized selecting candidates who were committed to carrying out his policy objectives.\nAcross the government, there are more than 3,000 executive positions the president can fill without regard to Civil Service rules. They range from those of cabinet officers to personal secretaries. About 500 are subject to Senate confirmation.\nThe trick for any president, Mr. Light said, is to fill the top jobs and those that require particular expertise with especially qualified people and then find other positions for job seekers with political or personal connections.\nCertain departments and agencies tend to become dumping grounds for those with connections. \"In a Republican administration,\" said G. Calvin Mackenzie, a government professor at Colby College, \"HUD is like a witness protection program.\"\nDemocrats are more likely to put their political cronies in the Commerce Department or the Small Business Administration.\nDavid E. Lewis, an assistant professor of politics at Princeton, recently published a study of 614 federal programs managed by 245 agencies. He looked at how each program was assessed under the scale the Bush administration's Office of Management and Budget uses to determine how well a program functions. Mr. Lewis found that programs run by political appointees \"get systematically lower management grades than bureau chiefs drawn from the Civil Service.\"\nOne explanation for Mr. Lewis's finding may be rapid turnover. Political appointees stay on the job an average of only two years or so, then take private-sector jobs where they use the experience and contacts they have gained in the government.\nIn an essay she wrote shortly after leaving the White House, Constance Horner, who was director of presidential personnel for the first President Bush, said:\n\"The job seekers continue to come in order, as they say in many variations, 'to give something back to the country' that's been good to them. They want only to serve 'this president' and no other. Alternatively (or perhaps more explicitly) they've 'paid their dues' and feel, however genteelly they put it, that they are 'owed something.\"'", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/24/politics/amid-many-fights-over-qualifications-a-bush-nomination-stalls-in.html"}
