Slice along both sides of the backbone, removing it along with the attached head and neck. Leave the first joint of the wings attached to each breast half. Season the breast halves and legs liberally with salt and leave at room temperature.\n2.Chop 1 rib of the celery, the carrot and half of the leek into 1⁄2-inch pieces. Put them in a large stockpot with the herbs and 5 smashed unpeeled garlic cloves. Arrange the wing tips, backbone and feet on top as level as you can. Add water to barely cover, 6 to 8 cups. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 30 minutes, skimming off impurities. Add the legs and breasts and weigh them down with a small plate to keep them submerged. Return to a boil, then lower the heat until barely bubbling and simmer for 30 minutes more. Let sit off the heat for 10 minutes.\n3.Meanwhile, cut the remaining celery and leek into ¼-inch cubes.
