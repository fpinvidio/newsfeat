LYONS\nWhat is Schengen?\nIt is an agreement to abolish border controls among the European nations that have joined. For the most part, people in any Schengen country can travel freely to any other without stopping to show a passport or visa, just as travelers can between American states or Canadian provinces. Only when entering from outside the Schengen area are a traveler’s credentials regularly checked.\nWhere did the name come from?\nIt is named for the town in Luxembourg where the original agreement was signed in 1985. The Schengen area began with just five countries and was set up separately from the European Union, but it was incorporated into the union’s 1997 Amsterdam Treaty with provisions for some nations to “opt out.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/world/europe/europe-refugees-migrants-rules.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
