Nathan Michael Smith, had said that while he supported fighting the Islamic State as a matter of policy, he believed that the current effort violated the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution, which limits combat operations to 60 days if Congress has not authorized the deployment. Because he swore an oath to uphold the Constitution, he said, he worried that obeying orders to participate in the operation violated his oath.\nBut Judge Kollar-Kotelly said Captain Smith’s desire to have a court clarify the legal issues was not a sufficient injury to give him a right to bring the case. While there are Vietnam War-era precedents in which courts ruled that soldiers did have a right to challenge the legality of their orders to deploy, she noted that those cases involved plaintiffs who did not support that war effort.\nThe dispute began in 2014 when the Islamic State swept out of Syria and rapidly conquered large areas of Iraq, and Mr. Obama ordered airstrikes to halt the group’s advance. The president said that while he would like a vote from Congress to endorse the campaign, he needed no new legal permission because operations against the Islamic State were covered by the authorization to use military force against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks — that is, Al Qaeda.\nThat theory was controversial because, while the Islamic State used to be Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Iraq, the two organizations had split earlier in 2014. But in a court filing, the Obama administration argued that Congress had ratified its theory by continuing to appropriate billions of dollars for the operation, knowing how the executive branch was interpreting its authority.\nWhile the two sides traded briefs, Judge Kollar-Kotelly said she did not need to hear from them in oral arguments before ruling for the government.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/politics/judge-lawsuit-war-isis.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
