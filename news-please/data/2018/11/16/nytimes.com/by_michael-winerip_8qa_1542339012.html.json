Over nearly 30 years, he has written five different columns — Our Towns, On Sunday, On Education (three times), Parenting and Generation B.\r\nHe has been a staff writer for the magazine, investigative reporter, national political correspondent, Metro reporter and a deputy Metro editor. For the 1996 presidential race he moved his family to a city that usually votes as America does — Canton, Ohio — and spent the year describing political and social issues important to the community.\r\nIn 2000, he was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his exposé in The Times Magazine about a mentally ill New York City man pushing a woman to her death on the subway. The article spurred the state to allocate an additional $215 million to community mental health programs. In 2001, he played a leading role on the team of reporters who won a Pulitzer for the series “How Race Is Lived in America.” His book on community mental health, “9 Highland Road,” was a finalist for the PEN nonfiction award. He also has written a series of children’s novels on the world’s greatest middle school newspaper.\r\nOverseeing the “Booming” series, he wrote about the 78 million Americans born during the postwar population explosion that stretched from 1946 to 1964.\r\nAmong the things that qualify him for the job is an 18-month stint writing a baby-boomer column for the Style section beginning in 2009. More important, his four children, ages 18 to 24, are all living at home with him this summer.\r\nBut most important of all — he was born in 1951.", "filename": "by_michael-winerip_8qa_1542339012.html", "image_url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/24/timestopics/michael-winerip/michael-winerip-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.jpg", "language": "en", "localpath": "/Users/federicoperezinvidio/Projects/illinois/newsfeat/news-please//data/2018/11/16/nytimes.com/by_michael-winerip_8qa_1542339012.html", "title": "Michael Winerip", "title_page": "Michael Winerip", "title_rss": "NULL", "source_domain": "nytimes.com", "text": "Mike Winerip hasn’t held every job at The Times, just most of them.
