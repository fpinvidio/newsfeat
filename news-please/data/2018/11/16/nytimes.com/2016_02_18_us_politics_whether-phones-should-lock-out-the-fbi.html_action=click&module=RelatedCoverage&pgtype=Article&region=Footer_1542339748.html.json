More practically, though, it boils down to this question: Should you be able to lock your phone so securely that even the F.B.I. cannot open it?\nThe Obama administration and police officers around the country say no, and their precedent is the past. Homes and cars do not have unbreakable locks. You cannot buy an uncrackable safe. And terrorists and child molesters should not be able to buy a hand-held computer that keeps its secrets forever.\nApple, backed by technologists and civil libertarians, says yes. People live their lives electronically; their phones are a record of loves and fantasies, illnesses and losses. Apple built its recent iPhones to keep that data private and says nothing less than the future of privacy is at stake in this fight.\nThe Justice Department’s success in obtaining a court order demanding that Apple help write software to disable those defenses was a significant victory for the Obama administration. It relied on the All Writs Act, a law that can trace its origins to the first Congress in 1789. In short, it says courts can require that people do things to comply with their orders.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/us/politics/whether-phones-should-lock-out-the-fbi.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
