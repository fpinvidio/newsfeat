Very nice to see you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="43" data-total-count="1364">VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH BIDEN: How you doing?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="78" data-total-count="1442">MS. RADDATZ: Hey, you got your little wave to the families in. That’s great.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="75" data-total-count="1517">Good evening, gentlemen. It really is an honor to be here with both of you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="403" data-total-count="1920">I would like to begin with Libya on a rather somber note. One month ago tonight, on the anniversary of 9/11, Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other brave Americans were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi. The State Department has now made clear there were no protesters there. It was a pre-planned assault by heavily armed men. Wasn’t this a massive intelligence failure, Vice President Biden?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="138" data-total-count="2058">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: What it was, it was a tragedy, Martha. It -- Chris Stevens was one of our best. We lost three other brave Americans.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="149" data-total-count="2207">And I can make absolutely two commitments to you and all of the American people tonight: One, we will find and bring to justice the men who did this.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="215" data-total-count="2422">And secondly, we will get to the bottom of it, and whatever -- wherever the facts lead us, wherever they lead us, w will make clear to the American public, because whatever mistakes were made will not be made again.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="277" data-total-count="2699">When you’re looking at a president, Martha, it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility. That’s carrying forward the national security of the country. And the best way to do that is take a look at how he’s handled he issues of the day.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="229" data-total-count="2928">On Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake; we should have left -- that he ended it -- Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake; we should have left 30,000 troops there.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="172" data-total-count="3100" id="story-continues-4">With regard to Afghanistan, he said he will end the war in 2014. Governor Romney said we should not set a date, number one, and number two, with regard to 2014, it depends.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="3307">When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president, the first day in office -- I was sitting with him in the Oval Office. He called in the CIA and signed an order saying, my highest priority is to get bin Laden.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="440" data-total-count="3747">Prior to the election, prior to the -- him being sworn in, Governor Romney was asked a question about how he would proceed. He said, I wouldn’t move heaven and earth to get bin Laden. He didn’t understand it was more than about taking a -- a murderer off the battlefield; it was about restoring America’s heart and letting terrorists around the world know if you do harm to America, we will track you to the gates of hell, if need be.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="3926">And lastly, the -- the president of the United States has -- has led with a steady hand and clear vision. Governor Romney, the opposite. The last thing we need now is another war.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="3956">MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="435" data-total-count="4391">REP. RYAN: (Sighs.) We mourn the loss of these four Americans who were murdered. When you take a look at what has happened just in the last few weeks, they sent the U.N. ambassador out to say that this was because of a protest and a YouTube video. It took the president two weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack. He went to the U.N., and in his speech at the U.N. he said six times -- he talked about the YouTube video.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="459" data-total-count="4850">Look, if we are hit by terrorists, we’re going to call it for what it is, a terrorist attack. Our ambassador in Paris has a Marine detachment guarding him. Shouldn’t we have a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi, a place where we knew that there was an al-Qaida cell with arms? This is becoming more troubling by the day. They first blamed the YouTube video; now they’re trying to blame the Romney-Ryan ticket for making this an issue.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="435" data-total-count="5285">And with respect to Iraq, we had the same position before the withdrawal, which was we agreed with the Obama administration: Let’s have a Status of Forces Agreement to make sure that we secure our gains. The vice president was put in charge of those negotiations by President Obama, and they failed to get the agreement. We don’t have a Status of Forces Agreement because they failed to get one. That’s what we are talking about.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="217" data-total-count="5502">And when it comes to our veterans, we owe them a great debt of gratitude for what they’ve done for us, including your son Beau. But we also want to make sure that we don’t lose the things we fought so hard to get.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="489" data-total-count="5991" id="story-continues-5">And with respect to Afghanistan and the 2014 deadline, we agree with a 2014 transition. But what we also want to do is make sure that we’re not projecting weakness abroad, and that’s what’s happening here. This Benghazi issue would be a tragedy in and of itself. But unfortunately it’s indicative of a broader problem, and that is what we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy, which is making the world more -- more chaotic and us less safe.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="292" data-total-count="6283">MS. RADDATZ: I just want to talk to you about right in the middle of the crisis. Governor Romney -- and you’re talking about this again tonight -- talked about the weakness, talked about apologies from the Obama administration. Was that really appropriate right in the middle of the crisis?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="188" data-total-count="6471">REP. RYAN: On that same day, the Obama administration had the exact same position. Let’s recall that they disavowed their own statement that they had put out earlier in the day in Cairo.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="594" data-total-count="7065">So we had the same position, but we will -- it’s never to early to speak out for our values. We should have spoken out right away when the Green Revolution was up and starting, when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their people. We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people. We should always stand up for peace, for democracy, for individual rights, and we should not be imposing these devastating defense cuts, because what that does when we equivocate on our values, when we show that we’re cutting our own defense --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="61" data-total-count="7126">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Am I going to get to say anything here?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="209" data-total-count="7335">REP. RYAN: -- it makes us more weak. It projects weakness, and when we look weak, our adversaries are much more willing to test us, they’re more brazen in their attacks, and our allies are less willing to --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="84" data-total-count="7419">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: With all due respect, that’s a bunch of malarkey. In fact --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="32" data-total-count="7451">MS. RADDATZ: And why is that so?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="85" data-total-count="7536">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Because not a single thing he said is accurate. First of all --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="25" data-total-count="7561">MS. RADDATZ: Be specific.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="250" data-total-count="7811">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I will be very specific. Number one, the -- this lecture on embassy security -- the congressman here cut embassy security in his budget by $300 million below what we asked for, number one. So much for the embassy security piece.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="8113" id="story-continues-6">Number two, Governor Romney, before he knew the facts, before he even knew that our ambassador was killed, he was out making a political statement which was panned by the media around the world. And this talk about this -- this weakness, I -- I don’t understand what my friend’s talking about here.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="481" data-total-count="8594">We -- this is a president who’s gone out and done everything he has said he was going to do. This is the guy who’s repaired our alliances so the rest of the world follows us again. This is the guy who brought the entire world, including Russia and China, to bring about the most devastating, most devastating -- the most devastating efforts on Iran to make sure that they in fact stop with their -- look, I -- I -- I just -- I mean, these guys bet against America all the time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="15" data-total-count="8609">REP.

RADDATZ: What were you first told about the attack? Why were people talking about protests? When people in the consulate first saw armed men attacking with guns, there were no protesters. Why did that go on for weeks?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="67" data-total-count="8988">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Because that’s exactly what we were told --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="20" data-total-count="9008">MS. RADDATZ: By who?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="446" data-total-count="9454">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- by the intelligence community. The intelligence community told us that. As they learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their assessment. That’s why there’s also an investigation headed by Tom Pickering, a leading diplomat in the -- from the Reagan years, who is doing an investigation as to whether or not there were any lapses, what the lapses were, so that they will never happen again. But --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="49" data-total-count="9503">MS. RADDATZ: And they wanted more security there.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="428" data-total-count="9931">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, we weren’t told they wanted more security again. We did not know they wanted more security again. And by the way, at the time we were told exactly -- we said exactly what the intelligence community told us that they knew. That was the assessment. And as the intelligence community changed their view, we made it clear they changed their view. That’s why I said, we will get to the bottom of this.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="10206">You know, usually when there’s a crisis, we pull together. We pull together as a nation. But as I said, even before we knew what happened to the ambassador, the governor was holding a press conference -- was holding a press conference. That’s not presidential leadership.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="292" data-total-count="10498">MS. RADDATZ: Mr. Ryan, I want to ask you about -- the Romney campaign talks a lot about no apologies. He has a book called “No Apologies.” Should the U.S. have apologized for Americans burning Qurans in Afghanistan? Should the U.S. apologize for U.S. Marines urinating on Taliban corpses?</p><div id="story-ad-5" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

What we should not apologize for --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="44" data-total-count="10633">MS. RADDATZ: Burning Qurans (immediately ?)?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="469" data-total-count="11102">REP. RYAN: What -- what we should not be apologizing for are standing up for our values. What we should not be doing is saying to the Egyptian people, while Mubarak is cracking down on them, that he’s a good guy and then the next week say he ought to go. What we should not be doing is rejecting claims for -- calls for more security in our barracks, in our Marine -- we need Marines in Benghazi when the commander on the ground says we need more forces for security.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="72" data-total-count="11174">There were requests for extra security. Those requests were not honored.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="415" data-total-count="11589">Look, this was the anniversary of 9/11. It was Libya, a country we knew we had al-Qaida cells there. As we know, al-Qaida and its affiliates are on the rise in northern Africa. And we did not give our ambassador in Benghazi a Marine detachment? Of course there is an investigation so we can make sure that this never happens again. But when it comes to speaking up for our values, we should not apologize for those.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="184" data-total-count="11773">Here is the problem. Look at all the various issues out there and that’s unraveling before our eyes. The vice president talks about sanctions on Iran. They got -- we’ve had four --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="125" data-total-count="11898">MS. RADDATZ: Let’s move to Iran. I’d actually like to move to Iran because there is really no bigger national security --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="22" data-total-count="11920">REP. RYAN: Absolutely.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="479" data-total-count="12399">MS. RADDATZ: -- this country is facing. Both President Obama and Governor Romney have said they will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, even if that means military action. Last week former Defense Secretary Bob Gates said a strike on Iran’s facilities would not work and, quote, could prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations. Can the two of you be absolutely clear and specific to the American people how effective would a military strike be? Congressman Ryan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="69" data-total-count="12468">REP. RYAN: We cannot allow Iran to gain a nuclear weapons capability.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="533" data-total-count="13001">Now, let’s take a look at where we’ve gone -- come from. When Barack Obama was elected, they had enough fissile material, nuclear material, to make one bomb. Now they have enough for five. They’re racing toward a nuclear weapon. They’re four years closer toward a nuclear weapons capability. We’ve had four different sanctions at the U.N. on Iran, three from the Bush administration, one here. And the only reason we got it is because Russia watered it down and prevented the -- the sanctions from hitting the central bank.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="169" data-total-count="13170">Mitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007. In Congress, I’ve been fighting for these sanctions since 2009. The administration was blocking us every step of the way.</p><div id="story-ad-6" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="488" data-total-count="13658" id="story-continues-8">Only because we had strong bipartisan support for these tough sanctions were we able to overrule their objections and put them in spite of the administration. Imagine what would have happened if we had these sanctions in place earlier. You think Iran’s not brazen? Look at what they’re doing. They’re stepping up their terrorist attacks. They tried a terrorist attack in the United States last year when they tried to blow up the Saudi ambassador at a restaurant in Washington, D.C.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="13831">And talk about credibility. When this administration says that all options are on the table, they send out senior administration officials that send all these mixed signals.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="684" data-total-count="14515">And so in order solve this peacefully, which is everybody’s goal, you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds. Look at where they are. They’re moving faster toward a nuclear weapon. It’s because this administration has no credibility on this issue. It’s because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us from putting the tough sanctions in place. Now we have them in place because of Congress. They say the military option’s on the table but it’s not being viewed as credible, and the key is to do this peacefully, is to make sure that we have credibility. Under a Romney administration, we will have credibility on this issue.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="34" data-total-count="14549">MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="45" data-total-count="14594">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Incredible. (Chuckles.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="268" data-total-count="14862">Look, imagine had we let the Republican Congress work out the sanctions. You think there’s any possibility the entire world would have joined us, Russia and China, all of our allies? These are the most crippling sanctions in the history of sanctions, period, period.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="15084">When Governor Romney’s asked about it, he said, we got to keep these sanctions. When they said, well, you’re talking about doing more, what are you -- are you -- you’re going to go to war? Is that you want to do now?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="34" data-total-count="15118">REP.

How are they going to prevent war if they say that there’s nothing more that we -- that they say we should do than what we’ve already done, number one?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="161" data-total-count="15542">And number two, with regard to the ability of the United States to take action militarily, it is -- it is not in my purview to talk about classified information.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="384" data-total-count="15926">But we feel quite confident we could deal a serious blow to the Iranians. But number two, the Iranians are -- the Israelis and the United States -- our military and intelligence communities are absolutely the same exact place in terms of how close -- how close the Iranians are to getting a nuclear weapon. They are a good way away. There is no difference between our view and theirs.</p><div id="story-ad-7" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

The percentage of unemployed just fell below 8 percent for the first time in 43 months. The Obama administration had projected that it would fall below 6 percent now after the addition of close to a trillion dollars in stimulus money. So will both of you level with the American people?

My friend recently, in a speech in Washington, said 30% of the American people are takers. These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors. They pay more effective tax than Governor Romney pays in his federal income tax. They are elderly people who in fact are living off of Social Security.

Help people who are hurting get the skills they need to get the jobs they want. Get this deficit and debt under control to prevent a debt crisis.

Their kids were hit in a car crash, four of them -- two of them, Rob (sp) and Reid (sp), were paralyzed. The Romneys didn’t know them. They went to the same church. They never met before.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="29485">Mitt asked if he could come over on Christmas.

When he told me this story, he said it wasn’t the help -- the cash help; it’s that he gave his time, and he has consistently. This is a man who gave 30 percent of his income to charity, more than the two of us combined. Mitt Romney’s a good man. He cares about a hundred percent of Americans in this country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="157" data-total-count="30085">And with respect to that quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don’t come out of your mouth the right way.

RADDATZ: Let’s talk about Medicare and entitlements.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="208" data-total-count="36988">Both Medicare and Social Security are going broke and taking a larger share of the budget in the process. Will benefits for Americans under these programs have to change for the programs to survive, Mr. Ryan?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="37089">REP. RYAN: Absolutely. Medicare and Social Security are going bankrupt. These are indisputable facts.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="632" data-total-count="37721">Look, when I look at these programs, we’ve all had tragedies in our lives. I think about what they’ve done for my own family. My mom and I had my grandmother move in with us who was facing Alzheimer’s. Medicare was there for her, just like it’s there for my mom right now who’s a Florida senior. After my dad died, my mom and I got Social Security survivors benefits. Helped me pay for college. It helped her go back to college in her 50s, where she started a small business because of the new skills she got. She paid all of her taxes on the promise that these programs would be there for her. We will honor this promise.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="264" data-total-count="37985">And the best way to do it is reform it for my generation. You see, if you reform these programs for my generation, people 54 and below, you can guarantee they don’t change for people in or near retirement, which is precisely what Mitt Romney and I are proposing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="38287">Look at what -- look what “Obamacare” does. “Obamacare” takes $716 billion from Medicare to spend on “Obamacare.” Even their own chief actuary at Medicare backs this up. He says you can’t spend the same dollar twice. You can’t claim that this money goes to Medicare and “Obamacare.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="308" data-total-count="38595">And then they put this new “Obamacare” board in charge of cutting Medicare each and every year in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors. This board, by the way, it’s 15 people. The president’s supposed to appoint them next year. And not one of them even has to have medical training.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="269" data-total-count="38864">And Social Security, if we don’t shore up Social Security, when we run out of the IOUs, when the program goes bankrupt, a 25 percent across-the-board benefit cut kicks in on current seniors in the middle of their retirement. We’re going to stop that from happening.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="139" data-total-count="39003">They haven’t put a credible solution on the table. He’ll tell you about vouchers. He’ll say all these things to try and scare people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="39177">Here’s what we’re saying: Give younger people, when they become Medicare-eligible, guaranteed coverage options that you can’t be denied, including traditional Medicare.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="391" data-total-count="39568">Choose your plan, and then Medicare subsidizes your premiums, not as much for the wealthy people, more coverage for middle-income people and total out-of-pocket coverage for the poor and the sick. Choice and competition -- we would rather have 50 million future seniors determine how their Medicare is delivered to them instead of 15 bureaucrats deciding what -- if, where, when they get it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="47" data-total-count="39615">MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden, two minutes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="202" data-total-count="39817">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You know, I heard that death panel argument from Sarah Palin. It seems that every vice presidential debate, I hear this kind of stuff about panels. But let’s talk about Medicare.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="640" data-total-count="40457">What we did is we saved $716 billion and put it back -- applied it to Medicare. We cut the cost of Medicare. We stopped overpaying insurance companies when doctors and hospitals -- the AMA supported what we did. AARP endorsed what we did. And it extends the life of Medicare to 2024. They want to wipe this all out. It also gave more benefits. Any senior out there, ask yourself: Do you have more benefits today? You do. If you’re near the doughnut hole, you have $600 more to help your prescription drug costs. You get wellness visits without copays. They wipe all of this out, and Medicare goes -- becomes insolvent in 2016, number one.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="619" data-total-count="41076">Number two, guaranteed benefit -- it’s a voucher. When they first proposed -- when the congressman had his first voucher program, the CBO said it would cost $6,400 a year, Martha, more for every senior 55 and below when they got there. He knew that, yet he got it -- all the guys in Congress, and women in the Republican party to vote for it. Governor Romney, knowing that, said, I -- I -- I would sign it were I there. Who you believe, the AMA? Me? A guy who’s fought his whole life for this? Or somebody who had actually put in motion a plan that knowingly cut -- added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="115" data-total-count="41191">Now they got a new plan. Trust me, it’s not going to cost you any more. Folks, follow your instincts on this one.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="344" data-total-count="41535">And with regard to Social Security, we will not -- we will not privatize it. If we had listened to Romney, to Governor Romney and the congressman during the Bush years, imagine where all those seniors would be now if their money had been in the market. Their ideas are old, and their ideas are bad, and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="41838">REP. RYAN: Here’s the problem. They got caught with their hands in the cookie jar turning Medicare into a piggy bank for “Obamacare”. Their own actuary from the administration came to Congress and said one out of six hospitals and nursing homes are going to go out of business as a result of this.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="50" data-total-count="41888">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s not what they said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="147" data-total-count="42035">REP.

That’s a math thing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="192" data-total-count="44883">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, if we just did one thing, if we just -- if they allow Medicare to bargain for the cost of drugs like Medicaid can, that would save $156 billion right off the bat.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="45" data-total-count="44928">REP.

I was one of eight people sitting in the room that included Tip O’Neill negotiating with President Reagan. We all got together, and everybody said, as long as everybody’s in the deal, everybody’s in the deal, and everybody is making some sacrifice, we can find a way. We made the system solvent to 2033.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="530" data-total-count="46479">We will not, though, be part of any voucher plan eliminating -- the voucher says, Mom, when you’re -- when you’re 65, go out there, shop for the best insurance you can get; you’re out of Medicare. You can buy back in, if you want, with this voucher, which will not keep pace -- will not keep pace with health care costs, because if it did keep pace with health care costs, there would be no savings. That’s why they go the voucher -- they -- we will be no part of a voucher program or the privatization of Social Security.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="374" data-total-count="46853">REP. RYAN: A voucher is you go to your mailbox, get a check and buy something. Nobody’s proposing that. Barack Obama, four years ago, running for president, said if you don’t have any fresh ideas, use stale tactics to scare voters. If you don’t have a good record to run on, paint your opponent as someone people should run from.

If you’re in your 20s now, you get $4,700 a year less.

And something tells me --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="33" data-total-count="50259">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="76" data-total-count="50335">MS. RADDATZ: -- I won’t get a very simple answer. But let me ask you this.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="86" data-total-count="50421">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I gave you a simple answer: He’s raising the cost of Medicare.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="167" data-total-count="50588">MS. RADDATZ: OK, on to taxes. If your ticket is elected, who will pay more in taxes? Who will pay less? And we’re starting with Vice President Biden for two minutes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="838" data-total-count="51426">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The middle class will pay less, and people making a million dollars or more will begin to contribute slightly more. Let me give you one concrete example: the continuation of the Bush tax cuts. We’re arguing that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy should be allowed to expire. Of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, 800 million -- billion dollars of that goes to people making a minimum of a million dollars. We see no justification in these economic times for those -- and they’re patriotic Americans. They’re -- they’re not asking for this continued tax cut; they’re not suggesting it; but my friends are insisting on it. A hundred and twenty thousand families, by continuing that tax cut, will get an additional $500 billion in tax relief in the next 10 years, and their income is an average of $8 million.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="141" data-total-count="51567">We want to extend permanently the middle-class tax cut for -- permanently from the Bush middle-class tax cut. These guys won’t allow us to.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="51841">You what we’re saying? We say let’s have a vote. Let’s have a vote on the middle-class tax cut, and let’s have a vote on the upper tax cut. Let’s go ahead and vote on it. They’re saying no. They’re holding hostage the middle-class tax cut to the super wealthy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="559" data-total-count="52400">And on top of that, they got another tax cut coming that’s $5 trillion that all of the studies point out will, in fact, give another $250 million dollar -- yeah, $250,000 a year to those 120,000 families and raise taxes for people who are middle-income with a child by $2,000 a year. This is unconscionable. There is no need for this. The middle class got knocked on their heels. The Great Recession crushed them. They need some help now. The last people who need help are 120,000 families for another -- another $500 billion tax cut over the next 10 years.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="25" data-total-count="52425">MS. RADDATZ: Congressman.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="154" data-total-count="52579">REP. RYAN: Our entire premise of these tax reform plans is to grow the economy and create jobs. It’s a plan that’s estimated to create 7 million jobs.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="216" data-total-count="52795">Now, we think that government taking 28 percent of a family and business’ income is enough. President Obama thinks that the government ought to be able to take as much as 44.8 percent of a small business’ income.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="312" data-total-count="53107">Look, if you taxed every person in successful small business making over $250,000 at a hundred percent, it’d only run the government for 98 days. If everybody who paid income taxes last year, including successful small businesses, doubled their income taxes this year, we’d still have a $300 billion deficit.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="279" data-total-count="53386">You see, there aren’t enough rich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending. And so the next time you hear them say, don’t worry about it, we’ll get a few wealthy people to pay their fair share, watch out, middle class. The tax bill is coming to you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="59" data-total-count="53445">That’s why we’re saying we need fundamental tax reform.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="708" data-total-count="54153">Let’s take a look at it this way: 8-out-of-10 businesses, they file their taxes as individuals, not as corporations. And where I come from, overseas, which is Lake Superior -- (chuckles) -- the Canadians -- they drop their tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 25 percent, and the president wants the top effective tax rate on successful small businesses to go above 40 percent. Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. This one tax would actually tax about 53 percent of small-business income. It’s expected that’d cost us 710,000 jobs. And you know what? It doesn’t even pay for 10 percent of their proposed deficit spending increases.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="351" data-total-count="54504">What we are saying is lower tax rates across the board and close loopholes, primarily to the higher-income people. We have three bottom lines: Don’t raise the deficit, don’t raise taxes on the middle class and don’t lower the share of income that is borne by the high-income earners. He -- he’ll keep saying this $5 trillion plan, I suppose --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="33" data-total-count="54537">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="141" data-total-count="54678">REP. RYAN: -- it’s been discredited by six other studies, and even their own deputy campaign manager acknowledged that it wasn’t correct.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="54" data-total-count="54732">MS. RADDATZ: Well, let’s talk about this 20 percent.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="43" data-total-count="54775">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well -- (chuckles) --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="229" data-total-count="55004">MS. RADDATZ: You have refused yet again to offer specifics on how you pay for that 20 percent across-the-board tax cut. Do you actually have the specifics, or are you still working on it, and that’s why you won’t tell voters?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="127" data-total-count="55131">REP. RYAN: Different than this administration, we actually want to have big bipartisan agreements. You see, I understand the --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="102" data-total-count="55233">MS. RADDATZ: Do you have the specifics? Do you have the math? Do you know exactly what you’re doing?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="86" data-total-count="55319">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’ll be -- that’d be a first for the Republican Congress.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="576" data-total-count="55895">REP. RYAN: Look -- look at what Mitt -- look at what Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill did. They worked together out of a framework to lower tax rates and broaden the base, and they worked together to fix that. What we’re saying is here’s our framework: Lower tax rates 20 percent -- we raise about $1.2 trillion through income taxes. We forgo about 1.1 trillion (dollars) in loopholes and deductions. And so what we’re saying is deny those loopholes and deductions to higher- income taxpayers so that more of their income is taxed, which has a broader base of taxation --</p><div class="newsletter-signup hidden auto-newsletter variant-1-hidden " id="newsletter-promo" data-newsletter-productCode="" data-newsletter-productTitle="" aria-labeledby="newsletter-promo-heading">

Ronald -- I mean, excuse me, Governor Romney, on “60 Minutes,” I guess it’s about 10 days ago, was asked, Governor, you pay 14 percent on $20 million. Someone making $50,000 pays more than that.

RADDATZ: And that’s one of the biggest expenditures this country has made, in dollars and, more importantly, in lives. We just passed the sad milestone of losing 2,000 U.S. troops there in this war. More than 50 of them were killed this year by the very Afghan forces we are trying to help. Now, we’ve reached the recruiting goal for Afghan forces. We’ve degraded al-Qaida. So tell me, why not leave now? What more can we really accomplish? Is it worth more American lives?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="67530">REP. RYAN: We don’t want to lose the gains we’ve gotten. We want to make sure that the Taliban does not come back in and give al- Qaida a safe haven. We agree with the administration on their 2014 transition. Look, when I think about Afghanistan, I think about the incredible job that our troops have done. You’ve been there more than the two of us combined.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="478" data-total-count="68008">First time I was there in 2002, it was amazing to me what they were facing. When I went to the Arghandab Valley in Kandahar before the surge, I sat down with a young private in the 82nd from the Menominee Indian Reservation who would tell me what he did every day, and I was in awe. And to see what they had in front of them -- and then to go back there in December, to go throughout Helmand with the Marines to see what they had accomplished -- it’s nothing short of amazing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="60" data-total-count="68068">What we don’t want to do is lose the gains we’ve gotten.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="570" data-total-count="68638">Now, we’ve disagreed from time to time on a few issues. We would have more likely taken into account the recommendations from our commanders, General Petraeus, Admiral Mullen, on troop levels throughout this year’s fighting season. We’ve been skeptical about negotiations with the Taliban, especially while they’re shooting at us. But we want to see the 2014 transition be successful. And that means we want to make sure our commanders have what they need to make sure that it is successful so that this does not once again become a launching pad for terrorists.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="34" data-total-count="68672">MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="750" data-total-count="69422">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, let’s keep our eye on the ball. The reason I’ve been in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq 20 times -- I’ve been up in the Kunar -- I’ve been throughout that whole country, mostly in a helicopter and sometimes in a vehicle. The fact is we went there for one reason: to get those people who killed Americans, al-Qaida. We’ve decimated al-Qaida central. We have eliminated Osama bin Laden. That was our purpose. And in fact, in the meantime, what we said we would do, we would help train the Afghan military. It’s their responsibility to take over their own security. That’s why, with 49 of our allies in Afghanistan, we’ve agreed on a gradual drawdown so we’re out of there by the year -- in the year 2014.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="333" data-total-count="69755">My friend and the governor say it’s based on conditions, which means it depends. It does not depend for us. It is the responsibility of the Afghans to take care of their own security. We have trained over 315,000, mostly without incident. There have been more than two dozen cases of green on blue where Americans have been killed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="208" data-total-count="69963">If we do -- if the -- if the measures the military has taken do not take hold, we will not go on joint patrols, we will not train in the field. We’ll only train in the -- in the Army bases that exist there.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="387" data-total-count="70350">But we are leaving. We are leaving in 2014, period, and in the process, we’re going to be saving over the next 10 years another $800 billion. We’ve been in this war for over a decade. The primary objective is almost completed. Now all we’re doing is putting the Kabul government in a position to be able to maintain their own security. It’s their responsibility, not America’s.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="69" data-total-count="70419">MS.

We want -- look, one of my best friends in Janesville, a reservist, is at a forward operating base in Eastern Afghanistan right now. Our wives are best friends, our daughters are best friends. I want -- I want him and all of our troops to come home as soon and safely as possible.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="228" data-total-count="70963">We want to make sure that 2014 is successful. That’s why we want to make sure that we give our commanders what they say they need to make it successful. We don’t want to extend beyond 2014. That’s the point we’re making.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="350" data-total-count="71313">You know, if it was just this, I feel like we would -- we would be able to call this a success, but it’s not.

RADDATZ: Let me go back to the surge troops that we put in there. And you brought this up, Congressman Ryan. I have talked to a lot of troops. I’ve talked to senior officers who were concerned that the surge troops were pulled out during the fighting season, and some of them saw that as a political -- as a political move. So can you tell me, Vice President Biden, what was the military reason for bringing those surge troops home before the fighting season ended?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="485" data-total-count="74606">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The military reason was bringing -- by the way, when the president announced the surge -- you’ll remember, Martha -- he said, the surge will be out by the end of the summer. The military said, the surge will be out. Nothing political about this. Before the surge occurred -- so you be a little straight with me here, too -- before the surge occurred, we said, they’ll be out by the end of the summer. That’s what the military said. The reason for that is --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="92" data-total-count="74698">MS. RADDATZ: Military follows orders. They -- I mean, there -- trust me, there are people --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="29" data-total-count="74727">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Sure --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="76" data-total-count="74803">MS.

That was their recommendation in the Oval Office to the president of the United States of America. I sat there. I’m sure you’ll find someone who disagrees with the Pentagon. I’m positive you’ll find that within the military. But that’s not the case here.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="188" data-total-count="75348">And secondly, the reason why the military said that is you cannot wait and have a cliff. It takes, you know, months and months and months to draw down forces. (Inaudible) -- cannot wait --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="581" data-total-count="75929">REP. RYAN: Let me bring some -- let me try and illustrate the issue here, because I think this -- it can get a little confusing. We’ve all met with General Allen and General Scaparotti in Afghanistan to talk about fighting seasons. Here’s the way it works. The mountain passes fill in with snow. The Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta shura come over from Pakistan to fight our men and women. When it fills in with snow, they can’t do it. That’s what we call fighting seasons. In the warm months fighting gets really high; in the winter it goes down.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="373" data-total-count="76302">And so when Admiral Mullen and General Petraeus came to Congress and said, if you pull these people out before the fighting season is end, it puts people more at risk -- that’s the problem. Yes, we drew 22,000 troops down last month. But the remaining troops that are there, who still have the same mission to prosecute, counterinsurgency, are doing it with fewer people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="76328">That makes them less safe.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="34" data-total-count="76362">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Inaudible.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="130" data-total-count="76492">REP.

No one got pulled out that didn’t get filled in by trained Afghan personnel. And he’s -- he’s -- he’s conflating two issues. The fighting season that Petraeus was talking about and former -- and Admiral Mullen was the fighting season this spring. That’s what he was talking about. We did not -- we did not pull them out.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="62" data-total-count="77072">REP. RYAN: The calendar works the same every year.

They’re still fighting us, they’re still coming over the passes, they’ll -- they’re still coming in to Zabul or to Kunar, to all of these areas, but we are sending fewer people to the front to fight them. And that is not safe.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="103" data-total-count="77576">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s right, because that’s the Afghan responsibility.

We’re sending in more Afghans to do the job, Afghans to do the job.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="425" data-total-count="78790">MS. RADDATZ: Let’s move to another war, the civil war in Syria, where there are estimates that -- estimates that more than 25,000, 30,000 people have now been killed. In March of last year, President Obama explained the military action taken in Libya by saying it was in the national interest to go in and prevent further massacres from occurring there. So why doesn’t the same logic apply in Syria? Vice President Biden.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="228" data-total-count="79018">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It’s a different country. It’s a different country. It is five times as large geographically. It has one-fifth the population that is Libya, one-fifth the population, five times as large geographically.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="393" data-total-count="79411">It’s in a part of the world where you’re not going to see whatever would come from that war. It’s (seep ?) into a regional war. You’re in a country that is heavily populated in the midst of the most dangerous area in the world. And in fact, if, in fact, it blows up and the wrong people gain control, it’s going to have impact on the entire region, causing potentially regional wars.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="323" data-total-count="79734">We are working hand in glove with the Turks, with the Jordanians, with the Saudis and with all the people in the region attempting to identify the people who deserve the help so that when Assad goes and he will go, there will be a legitimate government that follows on, not an al-Qaida-sponsored government that follows on.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="420" data-total-count="80154">And all this loose talk of my friend, Governor Romney, and the congressman about how we’re going to do, we could do so much more in there, what more would they do other than put American boots on the ground? The last thing America needs is to get into another ground war in the Middle East requiring tens of thousands if not well over a hundred thousand American forces. That -- they are the facts. They are the facts.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="443" data-total-count="80597">Now, every time the governor is asked about this, he doesn’t say any -- he say -- he goes up with a whole lot of verbiage, but when he gets pressed, he says, no, he would not do anything different then we are doing now. Are they proposing putting American troops on the ground, putting American aircraft in their airspace? Is that what they’re proposing? If they do, they should speak up and say so. But that’s not what they’re saying.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="217" data-total-count="80814">We are doing it exactly like we need to do to identify those forces who, in fact, will provide for a stable government and not cause a regional Sunni-Shia war when Bassad (ph) -- when Bashir (sic; Bashar) Assad falls.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="80844">MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="74" data-total-count="80918">REP. RYAN: Nobody is proposing to send troops to Syria -- American troops.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="608" data-total-count="81526">Now let me say it this way. How would we do things differently? We wouldn’t refer Bashar Assad as a reformer when he’s killing his own civilians with his Russian-provided weapons. We wouldn’t be outsourcing our foreign policy to the United Nations, giving Vladimir Putin veto power over our efforts to try and deal with this issue. He’s vetoed three of them. Hillary Clinton went to Russia to try and convince him not to do so; they thwarted her efforts. She said they were on the wrong side of history. She was right about that. This is just one more example of how the Russia reset’s not working.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="779" data-total-count="82305">And so where are we? After international pressure mounted, then President Obama said Bashar Assad should go. It’s been over a year. The man has slaughtered tens of thousands of his own people and more foreign fighters are spilling into this country. So the longer this has gone on, the more people -- groups like al-Qaida are going in. We could have more easily identified the Free Syrian Army, the freedom fighters, working with our allies, the Turks, the Qataris, the Saudis, had we had a better plan in place to begin with, working through our allies. But no, we waited for Kofi Annan to try and come up with an agreement through the U.N. That bought Bashar Assad time. We gave Russia veto power over our efforts through the U.N. and meanwhile about 30,000 Syrians are dead.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="104" data-total-count="82409">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: What would my friend do differently? If you notice, he never answers the question.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="95" data-total-count="82504">REP. RYAN: No, I would -- I -- we would not be going through the U.N. on all of these things --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="350" data-total-count="82854">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Let -- let -- let me -- you don’t go through the U.N. We are in the process now and have been for months in making sure that help, humanitarian aid, as well as other aid and training, is getting to those forces that we believe, the Turks believe, the Jordanians believe, the Saudis believe are the free forces inside of Syria.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="186" data-total-count="83040">That is under way. Our allies were all on the same page, NATO as well as our Arab allies, in terms of trying to get a settlement. That was their idea. We’re the ones that said, enough.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="83195">With regard to the reset not working, the fact of the matter is that Russia has a different interest in Syria than we do, and that’s not in our interest.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="149" data-total-count="83344">MS. RADDATZ: What happens if Assad does not fall? Congressman Ryan, what happens to the region? What happens if he hangs on? What happens if he does?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="235" data-total-count="83579">REP. RYAN: Then Iran keeps their greatest ally in the region. He’s a sponsor of terrorism. He’ll probably continue slaughtering his people. We and the world community will lose our credibility on this. Look, he mentioned the reset.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="65" data-total-count="83644">MS. RADDATZ: So what would Romney-Ryan do about that credibility?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="441" data-total-count="84085">REP. RYAN: Well, we agree with the same red line, actually, they do on chemical weapons, but not putting American troops in, other than to secure those chemical weapons. They’re right about that. But what we should have done earlier is work with those freedom fighters, those dissidents in Syria. We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer, and we should not have -- we should not have waited to Russia to give us the green light --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="47" data-total-count="84132">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We didn’t call Assad --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="42" data-total-count="84174">MS.

But putting American troops on the ground, that’s got to be within the national security interests of the American people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="58" data-total-count="85457">MS. RADDATZ: I want to -- we’re almost out of time here.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="85708">REP.

But if you’re talking about putting American troops on the ground, only in our national security interests.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="467" data-total-count="86175">MS. RADDATZ: I want to move on, and I want to return home for these last few questions. This debate is indeed historic. We have two Catholic candidates, first time on a stage such as this, and I would like to ask you both to tell me what role your religion has played in your own personal views on abortion. Please talk about how you came to that decision. Talk about how your religion played a part in that. And please, this is such an emotional issue for so many --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="16" data-total-count="86191">REP. RYAN: Sure.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="105" data-total-count="86296">MS. RADDATZ: -- people in this country. Please talk personally about this if you could. Congressman Ryan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="86571">REP. RYAN: I don’t see how a person can separate their public life from their private life or from their faith. Our faith informs us in everything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, about how to make sure that people have a chance in life.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="503" data-total-count="87074">Now, you want to ask basically why I’m pro-life? It’s not simply because of my Catholic faith. That’s a factor, of course, but it’s also because of reason and science. You know, I think about 10 1/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born for our seven-week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. Our little baby was in the shape of a bean, and to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn child, Liza, “Bean.” (Chuckles.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="46" data-total-count="87120">Now, I believe that life begins at conception.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="57" data-total-count="87177">That’s why -- those are the reasons why I’m pro-life.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="87407">Now, I understand this is a difficult issue. And I respect people who don’t agree with me on this. But the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortion with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="457" data-total-count="87864">What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what they’re doing through “Obamacare” with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country. They’re infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals. Our church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious -- religious liberties.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="435" data-total-count="88299">And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they want it to be safe, legal and rare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding, taxpayer funding in “Obamacare,” taxpayer funding with foreign aid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized or wouldn’t second- guess their one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations. That, to me, is pretty extreme.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="34" data-total-count="88333">MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="88614">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: My religion defines who I am. And I’ve been a practicing Catholic my whole life. And it has particularly informed my social doctrine. Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those who -- who can’t take care of themselves, people who need help.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="88837">With regard to -- with regard to abortion, I accept my church’s position on abortion as a -- what we call de fide (doctrine ?). Life begins at conception. That’s the church’s judgment. I accept it in my personal life.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="162" data-total-count="88999">But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews and -- I just refuse to impose that on others, unlike my friend here, the congressman.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="250" data-total-count="89249">I -- I do not believe that -- that we have a right to tell other people that women, they -- they can’t control their body. It’s a decision between them and their doctor, in my view. And the Supreme Court -- I’m not going to interfere with that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="405" data-total-count="89654">With regard to the assault on the Catholic Church, let me make it absolutely clear. No religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy -- any hospital -- none has to either refer contraception. None has to pay for contraception. None has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact. That is a fact.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="391" data-total-count="90045">Now, with regard to the way in which the -- we differ, my friend says that he -- well, I guess he accepts Governor Romney’s position now, because in the past he has argued that there was -- there’s rape and forcible rape. He’s argued that, in the case of rape or incest, it was still -- it would be a crime to engage in having an abortion. I just fundamentally disagree with my friend.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="90075">MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="350" data-total-count="90425">REP. RYAN: All I’m saying is if you believe that life begins at conception, that therefore doesn’t change the definition of life. That’s a principle. The policy of a Romney administration is to oppose abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. Now, I’ve got to take issue with the Catholic Church and religious liberty.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="86" data-total-count="90511">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You have, on the issue of Catholic social doctrine, taken issue.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="147" data-total-count="90658">REP. RYAN: If they -- if they agree with you, then why would they keep -- why would they keep suing you? It’s a distinction without a difference.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="33" data-total-count="90691">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="170" data-total-count="90861">MS. RADDATZ: I want to go back to the abortion question here. If the Romney-Ryan ticket is elected, should those who believe that abortion should remain legal be worried?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="91088">REP. RYAN: We don’t think that unelected judges should make this decision; that people, through their elected representatives and reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process, should make this determination.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="132" data-total-count="91220">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The court -- the next president will get one or two Supreme Court nominees. That’s how close Roe v.

Do you think he’s likely to appoint someone like Scalia or someone else on the court, far right, that would outlaw Planned -- excuse me -- outlaw abortion? I suspect that would happen.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="166" data-total-count="91711">I guarantee you that will not happen. We picked two people. We picked people who are open-minded. They’ve been good justices. So keep an eye on the Supreme Court --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="43" data-total-count="91754">REP. RYAN: Was there a litmus test on them?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="115" data-total-count="91869">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: There was no litmus test. We picked people who had an open mind, did not come with an agenda.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="96" data-total-count="91965">MS. RADDATZ: I’m going to move on to this closing question because we are running out of time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="184" data-total-count="92149">It’s certainly known -- you’ve said it here tonight -- that the two of you respect our troops enormously. Your son has served, and perhaps someday your children will serve as well.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="92387">I recently spoke to a highly decorated soldier who said that this presidential campaign has left him dismayed. He told me, quote, “The ads are so negative and they are all tearing down each other, rather than building up the country.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="126" data-total-count="92513">What would you say to that American hero about this campaign? And at the end of the day, are you ever embarrassed by the tone?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="21" data-total-count="92534">Vice President Biden.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="247" data-total-count="92781">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I would say to him the same thing I say to my son, who did serve year in Iraq: that we only have one truly sacred obligation as a government. That’s to equip those we send into harm’s way and care for those who come home.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="79" data-total-count="92860">That’s the only sacred obligation we have. Everything else falls behind that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="93185">I would also tell him that the fact that he, this decorated soldier you talked about, fought for his country -- that that should be honored. He should not be thrown into a category of the 47 percent who don’t pay their taxes while he was out there fighting and not having to pay taxes and somehow not taking responsibility.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="393" data-total-count="93578">I would also tell him that there are things that have occurred in this campaign and occur in every campaign that I’m sure both of us regret anyone having said, particularly in these special new groups that can go out there, raise all the money they want, not have to identify themselves and say the most scurrilous things about the other candidate. It’s -- it’s -- it’s an abomination.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="488" data-total-count="94066">But the bottom line here is I’d ask that hero you reference to take a look at whether or not Governor Romney or President Obama has the conviction to help lift up the middle class, restore them to where they were before this Great Recession hit and they got wiped out or whether or not he’s going to continue to focus on taking care of only the very wealthy, not asking them to make -- pay any part of the deal to bring the -- bring back the middle class, the economy of this country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="337" data-total-count="94403">I would ask him to take a look at whether the president of the United States has acted wisely in the use of force and whether or not the slipshod comments being made by my -- my friend or by Governor Romney serve -- serve our interests very well. But there are things that have been said in campaigns that I -- I find not very appealing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="94433">MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="71" data-total-count="94504">REP. RYAN: First of all, I’d thank him to his service to our country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="141" data-total-count="94645">Second of all, I’d say, we are not going to impose these devastating cuts on our military which compromises their mission and their safety.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="355" data-total-count="95000">And then I would say, you have a president who ran for president four years ago promising hope and change who has now turned his campaign into attack, blame and defame. You see, if you don’t have a good record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone to run from. That was what President Obama said in 2008. It’s what he’s doing right now.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="294" data-total-count="95294">Look at all the string of broken promises. If you like your health care plan you can keep it -- try telling that to the 20 million people who are projected to lose their health insurance if “Obamacare” goes through or the seven point million -- 7.4 million seniors who are going to lose it.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="177" data-total-count="95471">Or remember when he said this: I guarantee if you make less than $250,000, your taxes won’t go up. Of the 21 tax increases in “Obamacare,” 12 of them hit the middle class.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="189" data-total-count="95660">Or remember when he said, health insurance premiums will go down, and $2,500 per family per year? They’ve gone up 3,000 (dollars), and they’re expected to go up another 2,400 (dollars).</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="295" data-total-count="95955">Or remember when he said, I promise by the end of my first term, I’ll cut the deficit in half in four years? We’ve had four budgets, four trillion-dollar deficits. A debt crisis is coming. We can’t keep spending and borrowing like this. We can’t just keep spending money we don’t have.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="306" data-total-count="96261">Leaders run to problems to fix problems. President Obama has not even put a credible plan on the table in any -- any of his four years to deal with this debt crisis. I passed two budgets to deal with this. Mitt Romney’s put ideas on the table. We’ve got to tackle this debt crisis before it tackles us.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="446" data-total-count="96707">The president likes to say he has a plan. He gave a speech. We asked his budget office, can we see the plan? They sent us to this press secretary. He gave us a copy of the speech. We asked the Congressional Budget Office, tell us what President Obama’s plan is to prevent a debt crisis. They said, it’s a speech; we can’t estimate speeches. You see? That’s what we get in this administration: speeches. But we’re not getting leadership.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="327" data-total-count="97034">Mitt Romney is uniquely qualified to fix these problems. His lifetime of experience, his proven track record of bipartisanship -- and what do we have from the president? He broke his big promise to bring people together to solve the country’s biggest problems. And what I would tell him is we don’t have to settle for this.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="34" data-total-count="97068">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Inaudible.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="22" data-total-count="97090">MS. RADDATZ: I -- I --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="38" data-total-count="97128">REP. RYAN: We can do better than this.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="51" data-total-count="97179">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I hope I’ll get equal time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="78" data-total-count="97257">MS. RADDATZ: I -- you will get just a few minutes here, a few seconds, really.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="494" data-total-count="97751">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The two budgets the congressman introduced have eviscerated all the things that the middle class cares about. It has knocked 19 -- it will knock 19 million people off of Medicare. It will kick 200,000 children off of early education. It will eliminate the tax credit people have to be able to send their children to college. It cuts education by $450 billion. It -- it -- it does -- it does virtually nothing, except continue to increase the tax cuts for the very wealthy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="97925">And, you know, we’ve had enough of this. My -- the idea that these -- so concerned about these deficits, I pointed out, he voted to put two wars on a credit card. He did --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="43" data-total-count="97968">MS. RADDATZ: We’re -- we’re going to --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="22" data-total-count="97990">REP. RYAN: He voted --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="65" data-total-count="98055">MS. RADDATZ: We’re going to the closing statements in a minute.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="41" data-total-count="98096">REP. RYAN: But let me -- just a second --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="56" data-total-count="98152">MS. RADDATZ: I -- you’re going to have your closing --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="80" data-total-count="98232">REP. RYAN: Not raising taxes is not cutting taxes. And by the way, our budget --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="43" data-total-count="98275">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We have not raised --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="100" data-total-count="98375">REP. RYAN: -- we increased spending by 3 percent a year instead of 4 1/2 percent like they proposed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="54" data-total-count="98429">MS. RADDATZ: Let me -- let me calm down things here --</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="80" data-total-count="98509">REP. RYAN: So not spending more money as much as they say is not a spending cut.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="255" data-total-count="98764">MS. RADDATZ: -- just for a minute. And I want to talk to you very briefly before we go to closing statements about your own personal character. If you are elected, what could you both give to this country as a man, as a human being that no one else could?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="99073">REP. RYAN: Honesty. No one else could? There are plenty of fine people who could lead this country. But what you need are people who, when they say they’re going to do something, they go do it. What you need are when people see problems, they offer solutions to fix those problems. We’re not getting that.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="440" data-total-count="99513">Look, we can grow this economy faster. That’s what our five-point plan for a stronger middle class is all about. It’s about getting 12 million jobs, higher take-home pay; getting people out of poverty, into the middle class. That means going with proven pro-growth policies that we know work to get people back to work, putting ideas on the table, working with Democrats -- that actually works sometimes -- and then getting things done.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="175" data-total-count="99688">MS. RADDATZ: Vice President, could we get to that -- to that issue of what you could bring as a man, a human being? And I really am going to keep you to about 15 seconds here.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="86" data-total-count="99774">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, he gets 40, I get 15, but that’s OK. That’s all right.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="54" data-total-count="99828">MS. RADDATZ: He didn’t have 40. He didn’t have 40.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="533" data-total-count="100361">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Now, let me tell you, I -- my -- my record stands for itself. I never say anything I don’t mean. Everybody knows whatever I say, I do. And my whole life has been devoted to leveling the playing field for middle-class people, giving them an even break, treating Main Street and Wall Street the same, holding the same responsibility. Look at my record. It’s been all about the middle class. They’re the people who grow this country. We think you grow this country from the middle out, not from the top down.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="185" data-total-count="100546">MS. RADDATZ: OK. We now turn to the candidates for their closing statements. Thank you, gentlemen. And that coin toss, again, has Vice President Biden starting with a closing statement.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="324" data-total-count="100870">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, let -- let -- let me say at the outset that I want to thank you, Martha, for doing this, and Centre College. The fact is that we’re in a situation where we inherited a god-awful circumstance. People are in real trouble. We acted to move to bring relief to the people who need the most help now.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="472" data-total-count="101342">And -- and in the process, we -- in case you haven’t noticed, we have strong disagreements. But I -- you probably detected my frustration with their attitude about the -- the American people. My friend says that 30 percent of the American people are takers. They -- Romney points out, 47 percent of the people won’t take responsibility. He’s talking about my mother and father. And he’s talking about the places I grew up in, my neighbors in Scranton and Claymont.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="306" data-total-count="101648">He’s talking about -- he’s talking about the people that have built this country. All they’re looking for, Martha -- all they’re looking for is an even shot. When they’ve been given the shot, they’ve done it. They’ve done it. Whenever you level the playing field, they’ve been able to move.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="343" data-total-count="101991">And they want a little bit of peace of mind. And the president and I are not going to rest until that playing field is leveled, they in fact have a clear shot and they have peace of mind, until they can turn to their kid and say with a degree of confidence, honey, it’s going to be OK. It’s going to be OK. That’s what this is all about.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="30" data-total-count="102021">MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="83" data-total-count="102104">REP. RYAN: I want to thank you as well, Martha, Danville, Kentucky, Centre College.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="85" data-total-count="102189">And I want to thank you, Joe. It’s been an honor to engage in this critical debate.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="453" data-total-count="102642">We face a very big choice. What kind of country are we going to be? What kind of country are we going to give our kids? President Obama -- he had his chance. He made his choices. His economic agenda, more spending, more borrowing, higher taxes, a government takeover of health care -- it’s not working. It’s failed to create the jobs we need. Twenty-three million Americans are struggling for work today. Fifteen percent of Americans are in poverty.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="391" data-total-count="103033">This is not what a real recovery looks like. You deserve better. Mitt Romney and I want to earn your support. We’re offering real reforms for a real recovery for every American. Mitt Romney, his experience, his ideas, his solutions, is uniquely qualified to get this job done. At a time when we have a jobs crisis in America, wouldn’t it be nice to have a job creator in the White House?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="197" data-total-count="103230">The choice is clear: a stagnant economy that promotes more government dependency, or a dynamic, growing economy that promotes opportunity and jobs. Mitt Romney and I will not duck the tough issues.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="103448">We will take responsibility. And we will not try to replace our founding principles; we will reapply our founding principles. The choice is clear, and the choice rests with you, and we ask you for your vote. Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="59" data-total-count="103507">MS. RADDATZ: And thank you both again. Thank you very much.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="32" data-total-count="103539">VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="103694">MS. RADDATZ: This concludes the vice presidential debate. Please tune in next Tuesday for the second presidential debate at Hofstra University in New York.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="104" data-total-count="103798">I’m Martha Raddatz of ABC News. I do hope all of you go to the polls. Have a good evening.
