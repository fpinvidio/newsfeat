Really.\nAsk Amy L. Moran, who dives under the Antarctic ice to collect and study the giant species that live in those cold waters. “Everything that they do is weird,” she said.\nThe males carry the young, for example. The spiders’ gonads are in their legs — and so are their guts.\nThe latest weird thing scientists have found out about sea spiders is how they solve the problem of getting oxygen from seawater without lungs or gills. Turns out, they have pores.\nAntarctic sea spiders grow to dinner-plate size. Elsewhere they’re mostly small, many less than a half-inch in diameter.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/science/sea-spiders-oxygen.html"}
