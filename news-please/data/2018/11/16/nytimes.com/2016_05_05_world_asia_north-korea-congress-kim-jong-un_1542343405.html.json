Outside analysts who had predicted openness and diplomatic compromise under his young leadership — Mr. Kim had spent time in Switzerland as a teenager — had a surprise in store.\nThe young man had more than 100 senior party officials or generals, including his own uncle, executed, while he also let the Workers’ Party regain its influence on the military. Thousands more were demoted or banished. He engineered purges with such frequency and ruthlessness that President Park Geun-hye of South Korea called Mr. Kim’s rule a “reign of terror.”\nHis main selling point domestically has been his image as a strong young leader able to arm his country with nuclear weapons. In recent months, North Korea has tried to bolster that image by reporting success in a flurry of tests of technologies needed to acquire a nuclear strike capability, including the test of what it called a submarine-launched ballistic missile.\nNorth Korea conducted the last two of its four nuclear tests under Mr. Kim, including one on Jan. 6. The North also placed two satellites into orbit, the most recent in February, by using rockets widely believed to be a cover for developing an intercontinental ballistic missile.\nNorth Korea’s news media did not report what South Korean and United States officials called three successive failures in launching its Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile in recent weeks.\nJeong Joon-hee, a South Korean government spokesman, said he suspected that the North Korean military pressed ahead with the doomed tests to help glorify Mr. Kim’s image ahead of the party congress.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/world/asia/north-korea-congress-kim-jong-un.html"}
