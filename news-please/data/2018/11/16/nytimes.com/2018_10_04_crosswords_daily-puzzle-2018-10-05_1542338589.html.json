I loved the bookends she mentions in her notes — both debuts, surprisingly! And beyond the tough stuff, every second fill entry made me smile as well — things like PERSON, CLUBS and SCHMO, for example.\nI liked the fliers (I know, penguins don’t count) — witches, geese, stages and churches. I also liked the little stack of financial references to “bucks,” “time” and a GOLD COIN.\n17A: Dressing vs. stuffing, let the battle commence. I feel like I’ve trotted this map out before. I tend to think of dressing as oil and vinegar, and upon settling upon STALE BREAD here, thought, “Hm! Panzanella?” before realizing that yipes, it’s October. I made gluten free stuffing year before last, I think, and it was no bueno. I’m sure there’s a way but every day is a day to give thanks for bread, if your system tolerates it.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2018-10-05.html"}
