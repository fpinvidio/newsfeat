Actually, Mr. Bugialli is something of a loose constructionist in the matter of tiramis u. There is no right way to make it, he said, so all versions in the city are the real thing - except the one at Sant Ambroeus.\nReal thing or no, how does a dessert that was barely known in New York three years ago suddenly become so popular?\nThe chefs who make it generally agree that the stage was set by the increased availability of imported Italian ingredients, especially mascarpone, which can now be purchased in many specialty markets. While cookbooks recommend ricotta cheese mixed with cream as a substitute, there is no comparison in either the texture or taste.\nNew Yorkers have fallen in love with tiramis u under the mistaken impression that it is light. ''That's the main reason,'' said Giovanni Francescotti, general manager of Castellano, where the dessert is made with cream and a dash of brandy.\nNina Balducci, who makes the tiramis u at Balducci's, agreed. In her version triple sec, brandy and orange extract are used, and the beaten egg whites are folded in. ''The egg whites make it seem light,'' Mrs. Balducci said.\nBut Pino Luongo, a co-owner of Il Cantinori, believes the popularity of tiramis u, which he makes with zabaglione, is much simpler.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n''It is the first Italian dessert that competes with the French,'' he said. ''French cuisine is very decadent, and the more decadence you have the better the dessert. When I serve tiramis u made to order and still warm, then the French can't compete.''\nShops that carry one version or another of tiramis u include Balducci's, Todaro Brothers and Sant Ambroeus. They will also make it to order for dinner parties. It is about $3 a serving.\nIt is on the menu regularly or occasionally at Il Cantinori, L'Hostaria del Bongustaio, Castellano, Positano, Sistina, Il Nido, Il Monello and Il Nido Cafe. Il Mulino and Felidia make it on special request.\nTiramis u (Il Cantinori)\n3egg yolks\n1 1/2tablespoons sugar\n4teaspoons dark rum\n1/2pound mascarpone\n2tablespoons plus 1 cup strong espresso, cooled\n18Italian ladyfingers (savoiardi);\nsee note\nSweet chocolate shavings for\ngarnish.\n1.*Whisk the yolks with the sugar until light. Whisk in two teaspoons of rum. Beat in the mascarpone until smooth and then beat in 2 tablespoons espresso until well mixed.\n2.*Add remaining rum to one cup of espresso. Dip each ladyfinger into espresso mixture; do not soak. Arrange 3 ladyfingers in a pyramid on each of 6 plates.\n3.*Divide the mascarpone mixture into 6 equal portions and spoon over the ladyfingers. Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate about 30 minutes or a few hours, if desired.\n4.*Sprinkle with chocolate shavings and serve.\nYield: 6 servings.\nNOTE: Italian ladyfingers, which are drier and larger than the American version, are preferable. They are available at many Italian specialty markets. If American ladyfingers are substituted, you will need about one-fourth more of them, and they should be toasted at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes to dry them out. Tiramis u (Balducci's)\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nNina Balducci adapted this recipe from one taught to her by Giuliano Bugialli.\n24Italian ladyfingers (see note\nwith Il Cantinori recipe for\ntiramis u)\n1 1/2cups espresso, cooled\n6eggs, separated\n3tablespoons sugar\n1pound mascarpone\n2tablespoons each Marsala,\ntriple sec and brandy\n1teaspoon orange extract\n8ounces bittersweet chocolate,\nchopped.\n1.*Dip 12 ladyfingers quickly in espresso.

Repeat layering with ladyfingers and remaining mascarpone mixture. Sprinkle with remaining chocolate.\n6.*Cover lightly with foil and refrigerate at least 1 hour or as long as overnight (but it is best to make the dish about six hours before serving).\nYield: 10 to 12 servings. Genoise Genoise is a cake similar in texture to ladyfingers. After it is baked the layers can be cut into strips resembling the fingers.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n3eggs at room temperature\n1/2cup sugar\n1/2cup flour\nPinch salt\n3tablespoons clarified butter,\nmelted.\n1.*Grease two 9-inch round cake pans. Line each pan with a round of waxed paper; butter paper. Dust paper and sides of pans with flour; tap off excess.\n2.*Place the eggs and sugar in a heatproof bowl; set bowl over pan of hot (not boiling) water. Beat at medium speed until mixture feels tepid, about 2 minutes. Remove from hot water. Continue beating until thick, light in color and tripled in volume, about 15 minutes.\n3.*Sift flour several times with salt, then sift mixture, one half at a time, directly over egg mixture, gently folding in after each addition. Drizzle clarified butter very lightly over batter; fold in gently.\n4.*Pour batter into prepared pans, dividing evenly. Bake 12 to 15 minutes at 400 degrees, until cake is golden brown. Remove from oven; invert pans on wire racks to release cake layers. Gently peel away waxed paper; let layers cool to room temperature.\n5.*To use for tiramis u, cut each layer in half and then cut halves into strips 1 to 1 1/2 inches wide.\nYield: 2 layers.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/06/garden/what-s-tiramisu-well-it-depends.html"}
