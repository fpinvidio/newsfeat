Trump declared himself “a big fan of Hindu” and praised India’s nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, at an Indian-American charity event on Saturday.\nMr. Trump spoke at a benefit put on by the Republican Hindu Coalition at a convention center in Edison, N.J., a non-battleground stop that is hardly typical for a presidential nominee three weeks before an election.\nStill, Mr. Trump seemed thrilled to be there.\n“I am a big fan of Hindu, and I am a big fan of India,” Mr. Trump said, seeming to entangle the faith with the nation. “Big, big fan.”\nWhile polls show that Hillary Clinton draws far more backing from Indian-Americans than Mr. Trump does, his anti-bureaucracy and country-first language closely tracks that of Mr. Modi, who has tapped into the disgust that India’s Hindu majority feels toward its government.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/us/politics/trump-modi-indian-americans.html"}
