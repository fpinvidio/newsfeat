It’s about bigotry.\nThat’s the real story — to the extent there is a story at all — about the caravan of 5,000 impoverished Central Americans rampaging toward the United States border at, er, two miles an hour.\nPresident Trump, ever the champion speller, declares this to be a “National Emergy”! He may call out the Army! He’s talking about sealing the border!\nSo, here’s some perspective, by my back-of-envelope calculations:\nMore than 1.4 million foreigners immigrate to the United States each year. If, say, half the caravan reaches the border, and half of those people actually enter the U.S., they would represent less than one-tenth of 1 percent of this year’s immigrants.\nIf the caravan proceeds by foot, during the period of its journey 16,800 Americans will die from drugs.\nIn the period of the caravan’s journey, perhaps 690,000 Americans will become homeless, including 267,000 children.\nIn the period of the caravan’s journey, 8,850 Americans will die from guns, including suicides and murders.\nIn the period of the caravan’s journey, perhaps 9,000 Americans will die from lack of health insurance (people die at higher rates when they’re uninsured, although there’s disagreement about how much higher).\nMaybe the real “National Emergy” is drugs, homelessness, gun deaths and lack of health insurance?\nTrump’s trumpeting isn’t protecting America, and the number of people is so modest that the issue isn’t really even immigration. Rather, it’s fearmongering. Scholars have found that reminding people of dangers makes them temporarily more conservative, so this kind of manipulation can be an effective campaign tactic.\nRemember the 2014 midterm elections? This is a replay. In the run-up to voting, Republicans ratcheted up fears of a “border crisis” with terrorists sneaking in from Mexico to attack us, plus alarm about Ebola and the risk that the outbreak in West Africa could reach America.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/24/opinion/migrant-caravan-trump.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2FNicholas%20Kristof"}
