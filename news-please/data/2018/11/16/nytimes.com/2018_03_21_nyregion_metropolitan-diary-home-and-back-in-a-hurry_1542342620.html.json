Could I make it home to West 66th Street and back in less than 40 minutes?\nI asked the agent if she would look after my suitcase, and raced off to the No. 1 platform. The train arrived in three minutes.\nI got to 66th Street, sprinted across the street, rushed to my apartment, unlocked the door and grabbed my computer bag.\nBack outside, I debated: cab or subway?\nI ran down the subway stairs with my MetroCard ready. People were streaming up. A downtown train was entering the station. I got stuck behind a man at the turnstile who kept trying unsuccessfully to swipe his MetroCard. I missed the train by seconds.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/nyregion/metropolitan-diary-home-and-back-in-a-hurry.html"}
