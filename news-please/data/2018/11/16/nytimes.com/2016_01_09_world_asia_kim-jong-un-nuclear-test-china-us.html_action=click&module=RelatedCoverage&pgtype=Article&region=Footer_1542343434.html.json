But with the North’s test of a nuclear bomb this week, he appears to have mastered a strategy that has served his reclusive country well: playing one big power against another.\nThe nuclear test quickly increased tensions between the United States and China. In a strong rebuke on Thursday, Secretary of State John Kerry called China’s approach to North Korea a failure, saying that something had to change in its handling of the isolated country it has supported for six decades. On Friday, China suggested that it was the Americans, not the Chinese, who were largely to blame for the North’s nuclear program.\nThe United States also used the North’s test to tighten a trilateral alliance with Japan and South Korea, a relationship that China has long viewed as a check on its power.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/09/world/asia/kim-jong-un-nuclear-test-china-us.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
