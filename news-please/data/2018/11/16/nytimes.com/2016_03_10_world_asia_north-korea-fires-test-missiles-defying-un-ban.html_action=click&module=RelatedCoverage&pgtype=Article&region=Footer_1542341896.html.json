They flew about 310 miles.\nUnder a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions, North Korea is banned from developing or testing ballistic missiles. The ban was imposed after the North’s tests of nuclear weapons and long-range rockets in recent years raised fears that the country was developing a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea also launched two Scud missiles in March last year.\nThe North often launches missiles when the United States and South Korea conduct their joint annual military drills. This year’s drills began this week.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/world/asia/north-korea-fires-test-missiles-defying-un-ban.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
