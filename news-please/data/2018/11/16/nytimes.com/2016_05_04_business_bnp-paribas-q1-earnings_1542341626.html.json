The results were bolstered by a 28 percent reduction in the funds it set aside for loan losses. Without those one-time adjustments, it said, net income would have been just 4 percent higher, at €1.6 billion.\nThat surprised the market consensus, which had been for a decline in profit.\nRevenue fell 2 percent from a year earlier, to €10.8 billion.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/04/business/bnp-paribas-q1-earnings.html"}
