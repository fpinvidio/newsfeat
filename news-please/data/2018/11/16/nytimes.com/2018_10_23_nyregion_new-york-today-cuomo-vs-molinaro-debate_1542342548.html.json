Andrew M. Cuomo and Marcus J. Molinaro, his Republican challenger, will finally debate.\nThe debate will take place this afternoon but will be broadcast at 7 p.m. on television and on radio on WCBS.\nThe meeting is Mr. Cuomo’s first one-on-one debate with his opponent in a general election since he was first elected. That fact alone makes it worth tuning in, according to Vivian Wang, who covers New York politics for The New York Times. Mr. Cuomo has held group debates in the past, but not a one-on-one in the general election in eight years.\nSo what will the two be debating?\nPublic Corruption. Mr. Molinaro has “talked a lot about the different corruption trials and convictions we’ve seen related to the governor’s administration this year,” Ms. Wang said. “He also says that the governor neglects upstate and that people need to be talking more about the economy there.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/nyregion/new-york-today-cuomo-vs-molinaro-debate.html"}
