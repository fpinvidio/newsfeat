There is a bright aquarium near the entrance, but it is devoid of life — much like the restaurant, which was eerily quiet the night I visited.\nThe restaurant is Italy Pizza, hailed by local guides as the hottest new dining spot in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. It serves up a taste of cosmopolitan savvy for the city’s elite — and proof to foreign visitors that all is well in the nation despite punishing economic sanctions, international isolation and intermittent reports of deprivation and famine.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/world/asia/north-korea-pyongyang.html"}
