            <p class="g-body">Our digital-subscription revenue also continues to grow at a strong pace, while revenue from digital advertising is growing in spite of the long-term shift of ad dollars to platforms like Google and Facebook. In the third quarter of 2016,
                our digital subscriptions grew at the fastest pace since the launch of the pay model in 2011 &#x2014; and growth then exceeded that pace during the fourth quarter, in a postelection surge. We now have more than 1.5 million digital-only
                subscriptions, up from one million a year ago and from zero only six years ago. We also have more than one million print subscriptions, and our readers are receiving a product better than it has ever been, with rich new standalone sections.</p>

            <p class="g-body">Yet to continue succeeding &#x2014; to continue providing journalism that stands apart and to create an ever-more-appealing destination &#x2014; we need to change. Indeed, we need to change even more rapidly than we have been changing.</p>

                For all the progress we have made, we still have not built a digital business large enough on its own to support a newsroom that can fulfill our ambitions. To secure our future, we need to expand substantially our number of subscribers
                by 2020.</p>

                There are many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/kodak-timeline.html">once-mighty</a> companies that believed their history of success would inevitably protect them from technological change, only to be done in by their

            <p class="g-body">Our focus on subscribers stems from a challenge confronting us: the weakness in the markets for print advertising and traditional forms of digital-display advertising. But by focusing on subscribers, The Times will also maintain a stronger
                advertising business than many other publications. Advertisers crave engagement: readers who linger on content and who return repeatedly. Thanks to the strength and innovation of our journalism &#x2014; not just major investigative work
                and dispatches from around the world but also interactive graphics, virtual reality and Emmy-winning videos that redefine storytelling &#x2014; The Times attracts an audience that advertisers want to reach.</p>

                of this strategy is increasing our digital subscriptions. Doing so requires our news report and newsroom to move past many habits that are holding us back.</p>

        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">These realities led to the creation of the 2020 group. Our seven members have spent the past year working closely with newsroom leaders; conducting hundreds of conversations with Times journalists and with outsiders; studying reader behavior
                and focus groups; and conducting a written survey of the newsroom. (An appendix contains excerpts from the survey responses.)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">Our group is the heir to the Innovation Committee, <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/05/the-leaked-new-york-times-innovation-report-is-one-of-the-key-documents-of-this-media-age/">whose 2014 report</a> and related work changed the culture
                of the newsroom. But 2020 has been different from the Innovation Committee in two important respects.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">First, we have had the benefit of working closely with Times leadership over the past year to begin implementing changes. As a result, this report is not intended to be the detailed guide for change that the Innovation Report was. Many of
                the changes we advocate <a href="http://www.nytco.com/press/blog/">are already well underway</a>. The details will continue to come from Dean, Joe and the rest of the leadership. This report is instead a statement of principles, priorities
                and goals &#x2014; a guide to help members of the newsroom understand more fully the direction that The Times is moving and to play an even bigger role in making that change happen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">Second, the 2020 group was charged with questioning the assumption behind the very first sentence of the Innovation Report: &#x201C;The New York Times is winning at journalism.&#x201D; We are indeed winning, but not at a scale sufficient to
                achieve the company&#x2019;s goals or sustain our cherished newsroom operations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">We have not yet created a news report that takes full advantage of all the storytelling tools at our disposal and, in the process, does the best possible job of speaking to our potential audience. More of our journalism needs to match what
                a large and growing number of curious and sophisticated readers have told us they value most &#x2014; distinctive journalism, in a comfortable form, that expands their understanding of the world and helps them navigate it. Our work too
                often instead reflects conventions built up over many decades, when we spoke to our readers once a day, when we cultivated an aura of detachment from them and when by far our most powerful tool was the written word. To keep our current
                readers and attract new ones we must more often apply Times values to the new forms of journalism now available to us.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">For The Times to become an even more attractive destination to readers &#x2014; and to maintain and strengthen its position in the years ahead &#x2014; three broad areas of change are necessary. Our report must change. Our staff must change.
                And the way we work must change.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-chapter ">
            <h2>Our report</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The Times publishes about 200 pieces of journalism every day. This number typically includes some of the best work published anywhere. It also includes too many stories that lack significant impact or audience &#x2014; that do not help make
                The Times a valuable destination.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">What kinds of stories? Incremental news stories that are little different from what can be found in the freely available competition. Features and columns with little urgency. Stories written in a dense, institutional language that fails to
                clarify important subjects and feels alien to younger readers. A long string of text, when a photograph, video or chart would be more eloquent.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">We devote a large amount of resources to stories that relatively few people read. Except in some mission-driven areas or in areas where evidence suggests that the articles have disproportionate value to subscribers, there is little justification
                for this. It wastes time &#x2014; of reporters, backfielders, copy editors, photo editors and others &#x2014; and dilutes our report.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The most poorly read stories, it turns out, are often the most &#x201C;dutiful&#x201D; &#x2014; incremental pieces, typically with minimal added context, without visuals and largely undifferentiated from the competition. They frequently do
                not clear the bar of journalism worth paying for, because similar versions are available free elsewhere.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">Our journalism must change to match, and anticipate, the habits, needs and desires of our readers, present and future. We need a report that even more people consider an indispensable destination, worthy of their time every day and of their
                subscription dollars. Specifically:</p>

        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The Times has an unparalleled reputation for excellence in visual journalism. We have defined multimedia storytelling for the news industry and established ourselves as the clear leader. Yet despite our excellence, not enough of our report
                uses digital storytelling tools that allow for richer and more engaging journalism. Too much of our daily report remains dominated by long strings of text.</p>

                York, a reader mocked us in the comments for not including a simple map of the train line at the heart of the debate. Similarly, when we write about dance or art, our reporters and critics are able to include video or photography but only
                in a limited way; they lack the proper training to embed visuals contextually, and our content management system, Scoop, makes the placement of visuals an afterthought. (The advent of Oak, our new story creation tool in Scoop, is encouraging
                because it is designed to address these problems.) The same issues apply to our critics writing reviews on other topics, our sports reporters writing about well-executed plays and our foreign correspondents trying to convey a sense of

                the 2020 group, &#x201C;but to also know that you will probably receive no help with it.&#x201D; To solve the problem, we need to expand the number of visual experts who work at The Times and also expand the number who are in leadership

                media, television and radio, and it is consistent with the lingua franca of the Internet. One of its biggest advantages is that it can convey the distinctiveness of The Times, making clear that we&#x2019;re covering stories on the ground
                and doing so with expert journalists. In our own report, however, we still do not use this more approachable writing style often enough, and, when we do, we too often equate it with the first-person voice. The Times has rightly become
                more comfortable with the first person, but clear, conversational writing does not depend on it.</p>

        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">One major problem is the bottlenecks that limit our ability to launch new features, even when the tools already exist. A developer in interactive news put it well: &#x201C;We should be approaching the shape of our coverage with the same intent
                that we bring to our formal newsgathering and reporting.&#x201D;</p>

            <p class="g-body">To be clear, The Times is making progress in employing a richer, more digital mix of journalistic forms. The progress in audio, video and virtual reality are obvious examples. But the overall pace should accelerate, and more of our journalists
                should participate in the creative and production process. The value of The New York Times does not depend on conveying information in the forms that made the most sense for a print newspaper or for desktop computers.</p>

            <p class="g-body">Our largely print-centric strategy, while highly successful, has kept us from building a sufficiently successful digital presence and attracting new audiences for our features content. At the same time, we should make a small number of big
                digital bets on areas where The Times has a competitive opportunity, the way we did with <a href="http://cooking.nytimes.com/">Cooking</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/watching">Watching</a>.</p>

            <p class="g-body">The Times&#x2019;s current features strategy dates to the creation of new sections in the 1970s. The driving force behind these sections, such as Living and Home, was a desire to attract advertising. The main attractions for readers were our
                ability to delight and to offer useful advice about what to cook, what to wear and what to do. The strategy succeeded brilliantly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">Today, we need a new strategy, both for traditional features (meant to delight and inform) and for guidance (meant to be useful in tangible ways). Our approach has kept us from building as large a digital presence as the Times brand and journalistic
                quality make possible, and kept us from making our print sections as imaginative, modern and relevant for readers as they could possibly be. To be blunt, we have not yet been as ambitious or innovative as our predecessors were in the 1970s.</p>

                The Times will not be able to meet them simply by getting better at what we already do. In all likelihood, we will need a modern version of the 1970s features expansion: devoting newsroom resources to new areas, primarily to attract subscribers
                and engage new readers (which in turn will attract advertisers). There would be nothing wrong or new about doing so. The success of the 1970s features strategy helped The Times afford great investigative journalism and foreign correspondents

            <p class="g-body">The 2020 group&#x2019;s survey of the newsroom uncovered a deep desire among many reporters and editors to acquire new skills. They understand that Times journalism has already changed and will need to change even more. They want to play a

            <p class="g-body">Some of our hiring needs have nothing to do with new journalistic tools. They instead revolve around traditional beat authority. In the past, it was acceptable for Times coverage to be merely solid in some areas, so long as the total package
                was better than any other publication&#x2019;s. It no longer is acceptable. The Internet is brutal to mediocrity. When journalists make mistakes, miss nuances or lack sharpness, they&#x2019;re called out quickly on Twitter, Facebook and
                elsewhere. Free alternatives abound, often reporting the same commoditized information. As a result, the returns to expertise have risen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">This new reality forces The Times to take a clear-eyed look at the coverage of every subject that is central to our report and to evaluate whether it is good enough. Put simply, is it so much better than the competition&#x2019;s coverage &#x2014;
                which is largely free &#x2014; that we can plausibly ask readers to pay for our own?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">In many areas, the answer is yes; we employ journalists who are recognized leaders in their field. No other media organization has a report that is nearly as strong as ours overall. Yet we are not seeking merely to be better. We are seeking
                to be so much better than the competition that The Times is a destination that attracts several million paying subscribers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">In recent years, the newsroom has hired about 70 new people a year, as part of normal turnover to keep the newsroom population flat. In very rough terms, about half of these hires have fallen into the categories with the most direct impact
                on journalism: coverage leaders, reporters, videographers, graphics editors and others. This pace needs to accelerate, even though doing so will increase the need for newsroom turnover given budget realities. The 2020 group does not make
                this recommendation lightly; we also believe it is among the most important recommendations we are making.</p>

        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">Inside the newsroom, we sometimes conflate Times quality with Times staff, but our readers have a different view. If something appears in The New York Times, they see it as Times quality (either positively or negatively). The best of that
                work elevates The Times, and it&#x2019;s often the quickest and most economical way to reach new audiences or improve an aspect of our report.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">Indeed, freelance work is often among our best-read journalism, in both the newsroom and in Opinion. The successes are easy to name: Op-Eds, Op-Docs, book reviews, photography, pieces for the Magazine, Science, Styles, Travel, Upshot, Well
                and elsewhere, as well as news dispatches that fill crucial coverage needs. These are not merely isolated cases, either. On a per-dollar basis, our freelance-written journalism attracts a larger audience on average than our staff-written
                journalism.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">Yet the landscape is bifurcated. We also use contributors to provide obligatory coverage that doesn&#x2019;t resonate with readers and help to make The Times a destination. Much of this work exists because of print legacies or an aversion
                to relying on wire reporting even for dutiful, incremental stories. We rely on stringers in every state and around the world for routine coverage of stories that too often does not surpass the quality or speed of the wires and that requires
                considerable effort editing and coordinating.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">We need to be more creative, and ambitious, with the money spent each year on outside contributors. But we should not conflate changing our freelance spending with cutting it. When a newsroom budget is under pressure, freelance is often the
                most obvious candidate for cuts. Taking an across-the-board approach now would be a mistake. It is likely, in fact, that overall freelance spending should increase. But parts of it should be eliminated, as part of a rigorous review.</p>

            <p class="g-body">Our most successful forays into digital journalism, from both existing departments and new ones, have depended on distinct visions established by their leaders &#x2014; visions supported and shaped by the masthead, and enthusiastically shared
                by the members of the department. The list includes Graphics, the Briefings, Cooking, Well and others.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">This isn&#x2019;t an accident. The rise of digital journalism has given us many more ways to tell stories and to reach readers. But we need to make choices about what we&#x2019;re going to do and not do. We need to be more proactive than we
                were during the decades of a stable, thriving print business.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">These departments with clear, widely understood missions remain unusual. Most Times journalists cannot describe the vision or mission of their desks, and the identities of those desks remain closely tied to eponymous print sections. Most departments
                have not made clear decisions about who their primary audience is and and which journalistic forms are a priority (and which are not). Many people in the newsroom are hungry for such clarity and believe it will make them more effective
                journalists.</p>

        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The 2020 group believes that an effective vision spans three main areas:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-list ">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Journalism</strong> What will the team cover (and not cover), and in what forms? How will it distinguish its coverage from competitors&#x2019; coverage?</li>
                <li><strong>Audience</strong> Who is the target audience for each aspect of the team&#x2019;s report? How will these audiences find and experience the coverage, and what role will it play in making The Times a habit? What does success look
                    like, and how will departments know when they have achieved it?</li>
                <li><strong>Operations</strong> What skills does the group need? What, for instance, is the appropriate balance between reporters/content creators and managers/editors? How will the group interact with the print hub and other cross-department
                    teams?</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">In a print era, when the newspaper business was stable, the newsroom could do without tracking the success of individual elements of the report &#x2014; or the report as a whole. The excellence of the overall bundle overshadowed specific deficiencies.
                And it was cumbersome to quantify success. The Times continued to make money and to have a strong reputation. That was enough.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">But today our business is changing rapidly. We have much better data than we once did. And as strong as our reputation remains, our position in the market is under attack.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">Our management practices, however, remain mostly unchanged. Much of the newsroom does not set tangible goals, much less feel accountable for reaching goals. Even those with some access to data are exposed to just a narrow slice of it (like
                pageviews about individual articles via Stela), and they don&#x2019;t know what success looks like.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">Multiple people told the 2020 group that they were frustrated by a lack of understanding and transparency about newsroom goals. One said: &#x201C;I think people would appreciate our willingness to try different things if they were allowed
                a better understanding of why we&#x2019;re trying something an alternate way and what we hope to achieve.&#x201D;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">As we saw with Cooking, the mere exercise of setting targets, even rough ones, can be a powerful focusing mechanism. It allows for clear-eyed assessment of what is and is not working.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">Ultimately, goals will work only if they are coupled with accountability. The Times should be more willing to expand teams that are thriving, to change course for teams that don&#x2019;t appear to have the right approach, to shift resources
                away from teams that appear to be failing and to change leadership when appropriate. We&#x2019;re no longer in a period when most coverage leaders have the luxury of &#x201C;figuring it out&#x201D; over multiple years.</p>

        <div class="g-item g-rec ">
            <h3 id="3-we-need-to-redefine-success">3. We need to redefine success.</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The newsroom has embraced data and analytics over the past year, with positive effects. We now have a better sense for which of our work resonates with readers and which does not. We&#x2019;re producing more resonant work, and we have largely
                resisted the lures of clickbait.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">Now we need to take the next steps. The newsroom needs a clearer understanding that pageviews, while a meaningful yardstick, do not equal success. To repeat, The Times is a subscription-first business; it is not trying to maximize pageviews.
                The most successful and valuable stories are often not those that receive the largest number of pageviews, despite widespread newsroom assumptions. A story that receives 100,000 or 200,000 pageviews and makes readers feel as if they&#x2019;re
                getting reporting and insight that they can&#x2019;t find anywhere else is more valuable to The Times than a fun piece that goes viral and yet woos few if any new subscribers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The data and audience insights group, under Laura Evans, is in the latter stages of creating a more sophisticated metric than pageviews, one that tries to measure an article&#x2019;s value to attracting and retaining subscribers. This metric
                seems a promising alternative to pageviews.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">Yet the newsroom should also understand that no metric is perfect. To a significant extent, we will need to rely on a mix of quantitative measures and qualitative judgments when deciding which stories to do and to promote. Achieving the right
                balance is tricky. We neither want to equate audience size with journalistic value nor do we want to return to the days when we persuaded ourselves that a piece of journalism was valuable for the mere reason that it appeared in The New
                York Times.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The 2020 group&#x2019;s survey of the newsroom found that many reporters wished their editors had more time to help them sharpen stories in the early stages of reporting and writing. At the same time, many reporters, and editors, believe The
                Times wastes time and resources on repeated line-editing of individual stories, making changes of limited value.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The 2020 group believes strongly in the value of copy-editing. There is a high price for easily identifiable errors, such as spelling and grammar mistakes. An increase in such errors would send the wrong message to readers &#x2014; that our
                product is sloppy and lacks high value. When we publish sloppy stories, readers complain to us in significant numbers. At the same time, The Times spends too much time on low-value line-editing, such as the moving, unmoving and removing
                of paragraphs, and too little on conceptual editing and story sharpening, including on questions like what form a story should take. A shift toward front-end editing will need to involve changes in multiple parts of the newsroom, including
                the copy desk, the backfield and the masthead.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The Times currently devotes too many resources to low-value editing &#x2014; and, by extension, too many to editing overall. Our journalism and our readers would be better served if we instead placed an even higher priority on newsgathering
                in all of its forms.</p>

            <p class="g-body">For The Times to remain a destination &#x2014; a high bar in an age of social-media platforms &#x2014; the experience of reading, watching and listening to our work needs to be as compelling as the journalism itself. Achieving this goal will
                be far easier if our journalists and our product teams (comprising product managers, designers and developers) work more closely together. We need both journalists and product specialists to understand reader behavior, to develop a sharp
                view of the competition and to understand how different areas of coverage fit into the broader Times experience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">Each group needs a better understanding of what the other does. Despite great strides over the past two years, many product teams don&#x2019;t have a deep understanding of the newsroom, including how we think about our coverage and how we
                do our jobs. Much of the newsroom, similarly, doesn&#x2019;t understand what the product teams do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The central flaw in the current setup is that the newsroom ends up focusing on short-term problem solving (How do we make today&#x2019;s report excellent?), while the product teams focus on longer-term questions (What&#x2019;s the best future
                news experience?). Our editors still aren&#x2019;t involved closely enough in thinking about how the Times experience across different platforms should evolve, and our product managers often aren&#x2019;t aware of coverage priorities.
                The results can be problematic. For example, the design and functionality of our homepage have remained effectively static for the past decade.</p>

        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">But the newsroom&#x2019;s current organization creates dangers for the print newspaper &#x2014; and is also holding back our ability to create the best digital report. Today, department heads and other coverage leaders must organize much of
                their day around print rhythms even as they find themselves gravitating toward digital journalism. The current setup is holding back our ability to make further digital changes, and it is also starting to rob the print newspaper of the
                attention it needs to become even better.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The print hub made impressive strides in 2016, beginning to take over some functions from departments while also creating a series of successful new print-only sections and features. Progress in these directions needs to accelerate in the
                early months of 2017, to ensure that the print hub becomes more autonomous. A Times working group is examining how to continue improving the print newspaper, building off the recent progress.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">A more muscular print hub will also allow for the creation of more subject-focused newsroom teams, which can make our coverage more authoritative and sophisticated and allow it to rise above the competition more often. Our big news desks were
                built to fill sections in the print edition. As a result, high-priority coverage areas are spread across multiple desks, diluting them and limiting collaboration among journalists covering the same subjects. There is not enough coordination
                among some Times journalists who cover similar beats, and there is even less consideration about which audiences we&#x2019;re targeting and how they&#x2019;re expected to consume our journalism. The pending creation of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/jobs/nyt-climate-change-editor.html">climate</a>                and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/jobs/nyt-gender-editor.html">gender</a> teams is a step in the right direction.</p>

                of a changing New York Times is not new. The institution&#x2019;s great success over the past century has depended on its ability to change.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The Times <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/01/17/issue.html">was once filled</a> with short, dry articles documenting incremental news in business and public life. As recently as the early 1980s, our front page included
                10 stories a day and a smattering of small black-and-white photos. There was even a time when Times editors considered a crossword puzzle to be beneath the institution&#x2019;s dignity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">But as readers&#x2019; habits and needs changed, The Times changed with them. Our values did not change; our expression of them did. Previous generations of editors introduced a magazine, a book review, readers&#x2019; letters, daily features
                sections and color photography. The most recent manifestation of these changes is the creation of a digital report, first on desktop computers and then on phones, that is widely regarded as the world&#x2019;s finest.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The digital revolution, however, has not stopped. If anything, the changes in our readers&#x2019; habits &#x2014; the ways that they receive news and information and engage with the world &#x2014; have accelerated in the last several years.
                We must keep up with these changes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The members of the 2020 group have emerged from this process both optimistic and anxious. We are optimistic, deeply so, because The Times is better positioned than any other media organization to deliver the coverage that millions of people
                are seeking. The institution&#x2019;s values are exactly right for the moment. The strongest daily journalism, the meatiest enterprise, the hardest-hitting investigations and the most useful and delightful features will continue to make
                us stand out from the crowd. Thanks to our values and our great strengths, The Times has the potential in coming years to become an even stronger, larger, more influential news source.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">But we must not fall prey to wishful thinking and believe that such an outcome is inevitable. It is not. We also face real challenges &#x2014; journalism challenges and business challenges. If we do not address them, we will give our competitors
                an opportunity to overtake us. We will leave ourselves vulnerable to the same kind of technology-related decline that has afflicted other long-successful businesses, both inside and outside media.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="g-item g-text ">
            <p class="g-body">The task facing the leadership of The Times is more daunting than what those earlier generations faced, because of the scope of the digital revolution. Yet the essential challenge remains the same. We must be steadfast with our values and
                creative in realizing them. We must act with urgency.</p>

                    to think of stories for others to write that they could possibly edit or advise. Our structure and our approach (and hiring) should encourage shared responsibility, not rigid roles and hierarchies.&#x201D;</p>

                <p class="g-body">&#x201C;We spend too little time thinking about how stories will be told, which means we get too many stories that are middling in every way. I&#x2019;d like to see more time spent brainstorming and workshopping ideas at the front end,

                    top down. But it is important to maintain the commitment to copy editing, as it is essential to the quality of the journalism and the reputation of the news site.&#x201D;</p>

                <p class="g-body">&#x201C;It is too hard for a reporter or editor to get help on a special project. Each pod should have a graphics and/or interactives point person. They should be involved with reporting from the beginning, identifying which stories are
                    ripe for media and using their knowledge to make the most of a story.&#x201D;</p>

                    I do not propose we emulate BuzzFeed (Times readers come to us for specific reasons, obviously), but forcing us to justify traditional stories could make us re-think how we use non-traditional formats.&#x201D;</p>

                    your story could be stronger with the help of a graphic, but to also know that you will probably receive no help with it.&#x201D;</p>

                <p class="g-body">&#x201C;In simple terms, we need less head and more heart in our storytelling. Emotion is not something we tend to embrace, and we should. It&#x2019;s a major driver of loyalty. Of connection.... We write too often in a male executive

                    inject a bit more personality, the copy desk is quick to ferret it out, and it can be exhausting to push back on every single word or phrase. If we&#x2019;re going to loosen our style up a bit, the copy desk is going to be the key

                    betrayal when we&#x2019;re wrong. I think we&#x2019;ve chosen to go the route of a high-quality publication and standards are a big part of that. We need editors to keep that quality up.&#x201D;</p>

                    would appreciate our willingness to try different things if they were allowed a better understanding of why we&#x2019;re trying something an alternate way and what we hope to achieve.&#x201D;</p>
