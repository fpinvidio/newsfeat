They said he did not identify himself to the Russians as an F.B.I. agent and refused to meet face-to-face with his contacts. He would not travel outside the country to pass information and did not appear to live a lavish lifestyle.\nAlthough the F.B.I.'s internal security personnel have the ability to track each agent's use of F.B.I. computerized crime files, Mr. Hanssen's use of the databases was never questioned.\nMr. Hanssen's arrest confronted the Federal Bureau of Investigation with a serious security lapse and one of its most embarrassing counterintelligence failures in recent years. The bureau is the principal federal agency responsible for ferreting out spies against the United States.\nOver the years, Mr. Hanssen received several promotions, rising through the F.B.I.'s counterintelligence ranks even while, officials said, he was secretly supplying the Russians with highly classified data after 1991 when the Soviet empire collapsed.\n''The trusted insider betrayed his trust without detection,'' Mr. Freeh said.\nPlato Cacheris, Mr. Hanssen's lawyer, said that as of now his client would plead not guilty to the charges, but added that the case was still in its early stages. Mr. Cacheris suggested that the government's case might not seem as solid as it appeared, saying that prosecutors ''always talk like they have a great case, but we'll see.''\nAn F.B.I. affidavit filed in support of the charges against Mr. Hanssen, which was unsealed today, said he began his espionage in 1985 and spied undeterred for the Soviet Union and, after its collapse, for Russia. It said he continued apparently unfazed by the many changes Mr. Freeh imposed to strengthen counterespionage efforts in the aftermath of the case against Aldrich H. Ames, the C.I.A. officer sentenced to life in prison in 1994 as a spy for Moscow.\nThe affidavit, nearly 100 pages long, provided an unusually detailed narrative account. It included details intended to support the bureau's view that Mr. Hanssen had a long career as a Soviet spy, listing the dates that officials said he had contacts with the Russians, the texts of letters officials said he wrote to Russian officials, the payments officials said he received and the nature of the material he provided Moscow.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nLaw enforcement officials said the F.B.I. had secretly obtained the bulk of Mr. Hanssen's espionage file from the Russian intelligence service, which they said was in itself a counterintelligence coup for the United States.\nMr. Freeh said Mr. Hanssen's arrest was unrelated to the defection last October of Sergei Tretyakov, a Russian diplomat at the United Nations. Later, law enforcement officials said it was not Mr. Tretyakov who cast suspicion on Mr. Hanssen.\nToday, Mr. Freeh would not discuss how the F.B.I. learned of Mr. Hanssen's activities or why they had not been discovered sooner. He also would not say whether Mr. Hanssen had ever been subject to screening procedures like polygraph examination. Lie-detector tests are routinely given to F.B.I. employees who handle highly sensitive information and are authorized to deal with other countries or intelligence agencies.\nMr. Freeh said Mr. Hanssen's activity ''represents the most traitorous actions imaginable.'' He said the F.B.I. had not yet determined the full extent of the damage because agents did not want to risk tipping their hand by beginning such a review while the investigation was under way. Even so, Mr. Freeh said of the suspected damage, ''We believe it was exceptionally grave.''\nIt was evident today that F.B.I. officials were bracing for what they expect to be stinging criticism in the days ahead. Mr. Freeh said his agency had agreed to the appointment of a high-level panel that will assess the extent of the damage and review security procedures at the F.B.I. The panel will be led by William H. Webster, a former director of central intelligence and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nAs a reflection of the seriousness of the case, President Bush read a statement to reporters traveling with him on Air Force One, saying, ''This has been a difficult day for those who love our country, especially for those who serve our country in law enforcement and intelligence.''\nHe added, ''To anyone who would betray its trust, I warn you, we'll find you and we'll bring you to justice.''\nAttorney General John Ashcroft issued a statement that said in part, ''Individuals who commit treasonous acts against the United States will be held fully accountable.''\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Treason is a separate crime of passing secret military information to a country at war with the United States.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nProsecutors in Mr. Hanssen's case could seek the death penalty because of the deaths of the two Russian agents, in addition to fines of up to $2.8 million, twice the amount he is believed to have received from his spying. Justice Department officials have not said whether they will seek the death penalty.\nMr. Hanssen, a married father of six, has been held in a detention center in Virginia since his arrest at a park near his home in the Washington suburb of Vienna, Va. He was arraigned today in a Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va.\nMr. Freeh was in the F.B.I.'s command center at the agency's headquarters when Mr. Hanssen was arrested as he returned to his car after dropping off a package of classified documents, law enforcement officials said. Mr. Hanssen was ''shocked and surprised,'' Mr. Freeh said, but he did not resist arrest.\nAgents were exultant after the successful arrest, but the mood in the command center quickly turned somber as F.B.I. officials realized that it was one of their own agents who had just been taken into custody. It was Mr. Freeh who proposed the outside inquiry into the F.B.I.'s internal security procedures, a suggestion accepted by Mr. Ashcroft.\nAlthough the accusations against Mr. Hanssen are by far the most serious against an F.B.I. agent, he is not the first agent to be accused of spying. In 1997, Earl Pitts, who was stationed at the F.B.I. Academy in Quantico, Va., was sentenced to 27 years in prison after admitting he spied for Moscow during and after the cold war.\nRichard W. Miller, a Los Angeles F.B.I. agent who was caught spying, was arrested in 1984 and later sentenced to 20 years in prison. His sentenced was reduced to 13 years, and he was released in 1994 after serving nine years.\nToday, the government's affidavit said Mr. Hanssen volunteered to spy for Moscow in October 1985 when he was working as the supervisor of a squad that was responsible for the electronic monitoring of Russians in the vicinity of New York.\nHe sent a secret letter to Victor I. Cherkashin, the same official at the Russian Embassy in Washington who acted as the contact for Mr. Ames, the career C.I.A. officer who walked into the Soviet Embassy in May 1985.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIn the letter, Mr. Hanssen said he was aware that ''your service has recently suffered some setbacks.'' Then, in an apparent effort to demonstrate that the intelligence he could offer was genuine, he identified Boris Yuzhin, Sergei M. Motorin and Valery F. Martinov, all Russian agents who had been recruited to spy for the United States.\nBy then, all three had already been identified by Mr. Ames, but by passing these names to the Russians, Mr. Hanssen could be sentenced to death because Mr. Motorin and Mr. Martynov were later convicted in Soviet courts and executed for their actions.\nThe affidavit appears to clear up what counterintelligence officials have long said was a mystery that had perplexed them since 1989 when a covert investigation began into Felix S. Bloch, a State Department employee suspected of espionage.\nThe affidavit said that Mr. Hanssen compromised the investigation by alerting the Russians that the F.B.I. suspected Mr. Bloch of meeting in 1989 with a Soviet agent in Paris and Brussels. As a result, Mr. Bloch denied he had ever engaged in spying and declined to answer any questions and the F.B.I. inquiry collapsed.\nMr. Hanssen, whom the Russians referred to only as B, wrote articulate messages to his handlers that reflected his knowledge of spying, his need for anonymity and the risks he faced, the affidavit said.\nIn one message in July 1988, he wrote about his strict precautions to avoid detection. ''My security concerns may seem excessive,'' he wrote. ''I believe experience has shown them to be necessary. I am much safer if you know little about me. Neither of us are children about these things.''\nOver the years, Mr. Hanssen turned over information about ''dozens of United States government classified documents,'' including some involving the government's double-agent program, a study on K.G.B. recruitment operations against the C.I.A., an analysis of K.G.B. operations and ''a highly classified and tightly restricted analysis of the foreign threat'' to a top-secret American program.\nIn addition, the affidavit accused him of compromising electronic surveillance methods. Of Mr. Hanssen's actions, Mr. Freeh said, ''The F.B.I. entrusted him with some of the most sensitive material of the United States government and instead of being humbled by this honor, Hanssen allegedly abused and betrayed that trust.''\nBoris N. Labusov, spokesman for Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, said tonight on Russian television, ''There is an old home truth,'' in the intelligence business, ''that intelligence successes become known after a failure.''\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n''As long as intelligence services exist,'' Mr. Labusov said, ''there will be always a threat of disclosures of the people working for one or another of such services. And there will be disclosures, but I would not call it a usual practice. When a spy scandal is elevated to a political level, it is necessary to understand who and what is behind it, who derives benefits from it.''", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/21/us/fbi-agent-charged-as-spy-who-aided-russia-15-years.html?module=inline"}
