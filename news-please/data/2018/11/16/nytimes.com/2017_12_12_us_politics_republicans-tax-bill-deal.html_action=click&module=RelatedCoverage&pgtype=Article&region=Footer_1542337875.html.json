Lawmakers are discussing limiting the deduction to mortgage debt of up to $750,000 for newly purchased homes, a higher cap than the $500,000 limit in the House-passed bill but lower than the $1 million limit that currently exists and remains in the Senate-passed bill, according to Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/politics/republicans-tax-bill-deal.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
