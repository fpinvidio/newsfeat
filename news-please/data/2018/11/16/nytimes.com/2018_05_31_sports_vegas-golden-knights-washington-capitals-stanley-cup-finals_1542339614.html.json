When Holtby is on his knees over by the post, marooned there by a cross-crease pass, that net, empty and welcoming, can seem far bigger.\nGame 2 of the Stanley Cup finals Wednesday night was going to be tied until it wasn’t, because of a puck that was going in until it didn’t, blocked by a goalie who extended his stick hoping something good would transpire if he did. The Capitals defeated the Vegas Golden Knights, 3-2, to even the series at one game apiece before it resumes Saturday in Washington, where Holtby, after securing the first finals victory in franchise history, will be feted with a standing ovation that could last until autumn.\nHis save, with 1 minute 59 seconds remaining, prompted Alex Ovechkin to cover his eyes in disbelief, T.J. Oshie to slam his stick in gratitude because he was too tired to yell and Coach Barry Trotz to pay respects to those fickle deities known as the hockey gods.\nA dumped-in puck that had caromed off the back boards and across the crease zipped right to Vegas center Cody Eakin, who whipped a lateral pass to Alex Tuch, who one-timed the puck into the paddle of a stick shoved out by Holtby, who hauled it in like treasure. Tuch skated away with his eyes wide and his lips parted, still processing the disconnect between what he thought would happen and what did.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/sports/vegas-golden-knights-washington-capitals-stanley-cup-finals.html"}
