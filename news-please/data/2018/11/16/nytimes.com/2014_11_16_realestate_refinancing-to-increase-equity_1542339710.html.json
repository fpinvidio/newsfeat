Nothaft, the chief economist for Freddie Mac. Interest in 15-year loans has remained high for the last year, in fact, largely because of financial incentives.\n“The spread between the rate on a 30- and 15-year fixed has been unusually wide,” Mr. Nothaft explained. “Over the first nine months of 2014, it averaged almost a full percentage point. So if you’re able to handle the bigger payment on a 15-year, you can lower your rate by an extra percentage point.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/realestate/refinancing-to-increase-equity.html"}
