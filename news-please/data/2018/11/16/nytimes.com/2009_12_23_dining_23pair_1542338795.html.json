The acidity and fizz in good Champagne are the perfect foil for the crisp and greasy allure of fried food. Like wearing Gucci with Gap, Champagne can work well with everyday food.\nPhoto\nIf fried chicken is not what Iâ€™d serve during the holiday season, local fresh Peconic Bay scallops or Nantuckets, now in season, certainly are. At $20 or more a pound, they may be a little more Gucci than chicken, but they are a worthwhile treat. Quartered sea scallops can be substituted.\nWith strips of sweet peppers, all are battered and fried as a first course or a platter to pass with flutes of aperitif Champagne.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/dining/23pair.html"}
