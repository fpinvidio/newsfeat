Yup, I ain’t going nowhere.” “There&#39;s a lot of divisiveness in the country, right now, and I think people just need to go out and vote.” “I feel like in the last few years, few years, it’s taken a turn for policies I don’t agree with. And so, I’m hoping that even my little vote can help make some change.” “Most of the candidates I favor are lining up behind Trump, and it’s not because he’s the world’s greatest human being. It’s because he’s effective. He’s getting things done.”">
