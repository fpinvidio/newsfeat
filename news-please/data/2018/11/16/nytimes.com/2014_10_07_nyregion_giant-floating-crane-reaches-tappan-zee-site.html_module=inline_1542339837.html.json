Andrew M. Cuomo, who made the decision to build a $3.9 billion, twin-span replacement for the aging three-mile-long Tappan Zee after more than a decade of delays and studies by former governors and other public officials.\nMr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is running for re-election, turned the crane’s appearance into an opportunity to promote his campaign, taking note of what he said was his talent for overcoming governmental dysfunction.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/nyregion/giant-floating-crane-reaches-tappan-zee-site.html?module=inline"}
