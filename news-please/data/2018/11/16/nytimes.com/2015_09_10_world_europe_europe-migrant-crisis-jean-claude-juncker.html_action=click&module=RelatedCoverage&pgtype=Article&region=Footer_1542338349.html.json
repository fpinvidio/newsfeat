He argued that it was not only a humanitarian issue, but also a test of the European Union’s fundamental ability to act in a unified manner and in accordance with its values, rather than following bureaucratic language or practices.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/world/europe/europe-migrant-crisis-jean-claude-juncker.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
