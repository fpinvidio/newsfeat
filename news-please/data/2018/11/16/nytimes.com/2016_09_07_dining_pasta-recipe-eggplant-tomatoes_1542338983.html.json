It’s a technique I use often in tomato season when I have luscious but overripe tomatoes. (Gazpacho is another option.) Added bonus: The grater holes purée the tomato flesh but stop at the peel, so you can very easily get pure pulp without any bits of skin.\nSimmering down the tomato pulp with a little olive oil, garlic and chile is a fast and easy way to make a very fresh tomato sauce. If you cook it down a lot, it becomes intense and thick, like a sofrito, and can be the base of any number of more complex concoctions: soups, stews and rice dishes.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/dining/pasta-recipe-eggplant-tomatoes.html"}
