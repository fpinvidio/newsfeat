Ms. Passons restricted her agenda to downtown Manhattan, defined as 14th Street and below. “You don’t have to go to Times Square to experience the city,” she said, preaching to a one-person choir. “Everything you can find in Midtown, you can find down here.”\nI set out to prove her right, but on a budget more suited to my tastes.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/04/travel/new-york-city-budget-travel.html"}
