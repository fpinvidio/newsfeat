A TV personality, social-media fixture and model who loves to cook (and eat — especially bacon), Teigen made her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue debut in 2010 and was on the issue’s cover last year. With her irreverent charm and exotic looks — the product of a Norwegian father and Thai mother — she has forged an affable television presence, hosting her own Cooking Channel special, “Chrissy Teigen’s Hungry,” and co-hosting Spike TV’s new series “Lip Sync Battle.” This Sunday, the 27-year-old (who happens to be married to John Legend) will host the 2015 Billboard Music Awards with Ludacris on ABC.\nOn her cooking blog Delushious, Teigen writes with a stream-of-consciousness bluntness, interlacing recipes with the kind of salty vernacular that most people reserve for chats with close friends, including many an expletive. (One recent photo shows eight butterflied quail with the caption “Roasting Quail but feeling like I’m cooking Chihuahuas” — which is exactly what the splayed animals look like.) But her true domain is social media, where 2.2 million Instagram followers track her every wacky snapshot. On Twitter, she valiantly confronts cyberbullies, responding to one aggressive tweeter with this: “Did you go to school? At all? Ever?”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/t-magazine/illustrated-interview-chrissy-teigen-thinks-she-looks-like-kid-rock.html"}
