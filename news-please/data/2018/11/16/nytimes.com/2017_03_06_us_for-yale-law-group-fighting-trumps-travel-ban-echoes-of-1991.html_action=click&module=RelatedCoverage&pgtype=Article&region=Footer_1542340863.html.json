Reaction to the new restrictions seems destined to reprise that to Mr. Trump’s original order in January, and it echoes the Butcher’s oft-quoted line from Shakespeare’s “Henry VI, Part 2.” There is a crucial one-word change, though. This version goes: “The first thing we do, let’s call all the lawyers.”\nThat’s what opponents of the travel ban did in January. In short order, legal teams formed to represent immigrants who were suddenly detained at airports, with nowhere to go. Their challenge to presidential authority was sustained by federal judges, and their motivation underpins this short video from Retro Report, a documentary series that mines the past for guidance as to what may lie ahead. The focus is on a network of current and former students at Yale Law School who helped draft a legal petition that became part of the pushback that stopped the first Trump order in its tracks.\nFor Michael J. Wishnie, a Yale law professor involved in that effort, what happened in January was familiar. “It was very much a replay of what I had seen,” he told Retro Report.\nAs a Yale law student in 1991, Professor Wishnie was part of a team that worked on behalf of Haitians who had fled their country by boat after a coup there. They sought asylum in the United States, but instead were sent to the American naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and held behind barbed wire. Ultimately, a federal judge ordered that more than 150 Haitians be released and allowed to enter the United States.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/for-yale-law-group-fighting-trumps-travel-ban-echoes-of-1991.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
