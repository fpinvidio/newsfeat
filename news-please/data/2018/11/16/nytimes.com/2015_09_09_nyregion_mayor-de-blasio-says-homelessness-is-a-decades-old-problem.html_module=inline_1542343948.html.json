But what I think I have to do better is explain the origins of this problem and show people what we’re doing about it.”\nThe comments were in keeping with remarks made by the mayor on Monday, when he said that the aggressive policies of a predecessor, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, had contributed to a rise in street homelessness. In an op-ed article published over the weekend in The New York Post, Mr. Giuliani accused Mr. de Blasio of letting people sleep on the streets.\nMr. de Blasio said of Mr. Giuliani, a Republican: “I think he’s delusional. If you think about what Rudy Giuliani did as mayor, homelessness went up about 40 percent on his watch. He clearly doesn’t remember the fact that he chased, as he said, he chased and chased people, but he also deprived families of benefits they needed and help they needed.”\nAccording to city statistics compiled by the Coalition for the Homeless, an advocacy group, there was a 32 percent rise in the New York City shelter population between January 1994, Mr. Giuliani’s first month in office, and January 2002, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was inaugurated. The bulk of that increase occurred during Mr. Giuliani’s final year in office, amid a national recession.\nAides to the mayor said the 40 percent figure that Mr. de Blasio cited was based on a comparison with the daily shelter population on Jan. 1, 2002, rather than a monthly average.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/nyregion/mayor-de-blasio-says-homelessness-is-a-decades-old-problem.html?module=inline"}
