The gallery leads to the three main public spaces: a library with built-in bookcases and a fireplace, a formal wallpapered dining room and a 30-by-20-foot living room with built-in display cabinets and the second fireplace. Off the dining room are a breakfast room and a large eat-in windowed kitchen, with a service elevator, laundry and two staff rooms sharing a bath nearby.\nAt the back of the apartment, off a long hallway, is a private wing that contains the five en-suite bedrooms and a family room/playroom fashioned from two maid’s rooms. The large master suite has two walk-in closets and a tiled bathroom.\n“It’s all so properly laid out,” Ms. Boardman said. “It’s a real family apartment.”\nMs. Spring, who is a managing director of J. P. Morgan Private Bank, said she and her siblings have fond memories of their childhood home.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/realestate/family-of-christine-beshar-trailblazing-lawyer-selling-co-op.html"}
