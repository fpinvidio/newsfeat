Make that for dinner, with a glass of wine and some very good bread, and the morning will come bright and filled with possibility. Make it for lunch, and there is no nap required.\nMuch of the cooking can be done well in advance. Toast some fresh cumin for the carrots and the crème fraîche, then grind it fine in the mortar and pestle you really ought to get if you don’t have one already. Roast the carrots, and allow them to sit out at room temperature. You do not want them to carry the chill of a refrigerator onto the plate. Make the vinaigrette and the cumin crème fraîche. (I let the carrots sit in the vinaigrette once for about 30 minutes before assembling the salad and found the effect ambrosial.)", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/magazine/ludo-lefebvres-roasted-carrot-salad.html"}
