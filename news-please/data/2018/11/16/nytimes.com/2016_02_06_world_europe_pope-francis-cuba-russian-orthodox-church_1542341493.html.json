The Western and Eastern branches of Christianity split nearly 1,000 years ago.\nThe breakthrough also highlights Francis’s ties to Cuba, as President Raúl Castro “was involved in organizing the meeting,” the Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said at a news conference.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/world/europe/pope-francis-cuba-russian-orthodox-church.html"}
