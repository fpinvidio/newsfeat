Killing him, it is clear, only enhanced the appeal of his message to many admirers, who view him as a martyr.\nPressure on Internet companies to take down his work is growing, because legal experts say the First Amendment would prohibit the government from ordering restrictions. With emotions running high after the most lethal terrorist attack on American soil since Sept. 11, 2001, there is widespread frustration among counterterrorism officials and independent experts at his continuing impact. But possible solutions are divisive and complex, raising a tangle of issues involving technology, national security, religion and freedom of speech.\nOn Friday, the Counter Extremism Project, an advocacy group based in Washington, called on YouTube and other platforms to permanently ban Mr. Awlakiâ€™s material, including his early, mainstream lectures.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/19/us/politics/internet-firms-urged-to-limit-work-of-anwar-al-awlaki.html"}
