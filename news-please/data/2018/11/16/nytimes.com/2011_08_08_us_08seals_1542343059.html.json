All 38 people aboard were killed, including 30 Americans, 7 Afghan commandos and an Afghan interpreter. It was the single largest loss of American life in the Afghan war.\nMilitary investigators spent Sunday in the Tangi Valley, where the helicopter was shot down, combing the ground to try to verify the initial assessment that insurgents had used a rocket-propelled grenade to down the helicopter.\nAmerican and Afghan officials said Sunday that the Seals members and Afghan commandos had been called into Wardak Province as a “quick-reaction force” to assist an American ground unit facing stiff resistance from insurgent fighters.\n“This unit was engaged in heavy fire on the ground, and they called for help,” said one American official briefed on the mission.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
