While WikiLeaks did not reveal the source of the leak, the committee said last month that Russian hackers had penetrated its computer system.\nAmong the emails released on Friday were several embarrassing messages that suggest the committee’s chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, and other officials favored Hillary Clinton over Mr. Sanders — a claim the senator made repeatedly during the primaries.\nIn one of the emails, dated May 21, Mark Paustenbach, a committee communications official, wrote to a colleague about the possibility of urging reporters to write that Mr. Sanders’s campaign was “a mess” after a glitch on the committee’s servers gave it access to Clinton voter data.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/us/politics/dnc-emails-sanders-clinton.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
