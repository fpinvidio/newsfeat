Chen, the executive chairman and chief executive of BlackBerry; Lloyd H. Dean, the president and chief executive officer of Dignity Health; Enrique Hernandez Jr., the chief executive of Inter-Con Security Systems; and Federico F. Peña, who served as both energy and transportation secretary under President Clinton.\nThe four directors will leave in April, when the company holds its annual shareholder meeting. Mr. Pena, 70, is approaching the board’s mandatory retirement age of 72. Mr. Chen, Mr. Dean and Mr. Hernandez have served on Wells Fargo’s board for more than a decade.\nThe departures will reduce the number of directors on Wells Fargo’s board to 12 from 16, although the company is likely to add new directors as it works to diversify its board members’s skills.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/business/wells-fargo-board-members.html?module=inline"}
