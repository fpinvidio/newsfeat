See a metal-caged severed head swing from a chain like a gruesome tea ball! These dubious pleasures and more await in “Viking Destiny,” a bit of low-budget Nordic nonsense that only makes you appreciate the visual finesse and rowdy discipline of the History channel’s “Vikings.” Pillaging done right is nothing to sniff at.\nWhile we wait for season 5 of that show to resume, we can head to the mythical kingdom of Volsung, where the language is aphorisms (“A day of grief is longer than a year of joy”) and the king is dead. His putative heir is more wimp than warrior, but luckily a swapped-at-birth plot means the rightful heir, Helle (Anna Demetriou), a Richard Thompson fantasy of red hair and black leather, is as handy with a sword as a curling iron.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/movies/viking-destiny-review.html"}
