Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and an author of a paper on his group’s findings, which included the 38 percent figure. Based on how much the world has warmed, Dr. Wehner said, before the analysis he had expected an increase of only about 6 or 7 percent.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/climate/hurricane-harvey-climate-change.html?module=inline"}
