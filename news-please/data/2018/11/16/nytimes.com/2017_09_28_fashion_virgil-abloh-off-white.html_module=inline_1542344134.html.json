The interview has been condensed and edited.\nCan you tell us where we are right now?\nVia Manin is this street off the main area in the center of Milan. It overlooks a big public park. My office has been located here for the last five years but we only moved into this new space, like, this week.\nDoes that explain why you have no desk?\nI literally have no desk in the world. I work on the street, phone in hand. I’ve occasionally been stuck at the corner of Prince and Mercer Streets in Manhattan not even realizing I’ve been standing there for 20 minutes responding to messages.\nBeing as mobile as you are — traveling 320 days a year, visiting eight different cities just this past week — is not exactly conducive to having an office routine and a fixed address.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/fashion/virgil-abloh-off-white.html?module=inline"}
