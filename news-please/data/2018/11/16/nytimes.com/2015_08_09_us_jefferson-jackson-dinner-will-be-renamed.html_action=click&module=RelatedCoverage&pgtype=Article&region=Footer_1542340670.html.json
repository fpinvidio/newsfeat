A single-sentence resolution was approved overwhelmingly by a voice vote, said Sam Lau, a state party spokesman. The change will take effect after this year’s event in late October.\nThe annual dinner, which draws big crowds and presidential hopefuls looking for an early advantage in Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucuses, is named for Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. Both owned slaves, and President Jackson carried out a bloody campaign to remove Native Americans from the South to make way for white settlers.\n“The vote to change the name of the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner comes after much debate and discussion among our activists and grass-roots leaders around the state,” Dr. McGuire said. “This was not a decision that was made lightly. The vote today confirms that our party believes it is important to change the name of the dinner to align with the values of our modern-day Democratic Party: inclusiveness, diversity and equality.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/us/jefferson-jackson-dinner-will-be-renamed.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
