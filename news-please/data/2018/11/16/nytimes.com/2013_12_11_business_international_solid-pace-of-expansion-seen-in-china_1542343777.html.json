And a survey of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector produced a reading of 51.4 for November, unchanged from the previous month but solidly above the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction.\nTaken together, analysts said, the data painted a picture of an economy that is ticking along with perhaps a little less gusto than in the past few months, but much more robustly than at the start of this year. That was when slowing growth prompted Beijing to deliver a series of measures aimed at propping up activity. Those moves, and somewhat firmer demand for Chinese-made goods from overseas, have helped put the economy on track for an expansion of about 7.5 percent this year, economists said.\nThe November data, China analysts at the Spanish bank BBVA said in a research note on Tuesday, “point to a moderating, though still strong, growth momentum.”\nThe performance also provides a generally solid backdrop to an important meeting of Communist Party leaders that began in Beijing on Tuesday.\nAt that meeting — the annual Central Economic Work Conference, as it is formally known — China’s top leaders are expected to map out the country’s economic policy agenda for the coming year, effectively putting more flesh on the bones of the broad-brush policy pronouncements made at a larger party gathering last month. That meeting laid out the longer-term goals for revamping the Chinese economy in a bid to put its once supercharged growth on a more sustainable and balanced footing.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/business/international/solid-pace-of-expansion-seen-in-china.html"}
