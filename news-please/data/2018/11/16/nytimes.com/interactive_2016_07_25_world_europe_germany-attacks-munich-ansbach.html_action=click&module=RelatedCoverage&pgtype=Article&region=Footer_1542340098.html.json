He fled the train, then attacked a woman walking her dog before he was killed by the police.\nThe teenager was from Afghanistan and had apparently become upset after hearing the news of the death of a friend from home.\nInvestigators say they believe that he was a sympathizer of the Islamic State because they found a hand-drawn flag of the militant group in the room he had at the home of his German foster family. Within hours of the attack, the group claimed responsibility and called the teenager an “Islamic State soldier.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/25/world/europe/germany-attacks-munich-ansbach.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
