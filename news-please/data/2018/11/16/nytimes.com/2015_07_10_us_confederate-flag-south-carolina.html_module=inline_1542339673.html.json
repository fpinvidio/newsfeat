Nikki R. Haley, a Republican who called for the flag to come down after the massacre last month at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.\nMs. Haley’s office said that she would sign the bill into law at an event at 4 p.m. on Thursday at the State House. With Ms. Haley’s signature, the clock will begin to tick, and the state will have 24 hours to take down the flag, which will be moved to the Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum, near the Capitol.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/us/confederate-flag-south-carolina.html?module=inline"}
