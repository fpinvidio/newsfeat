Here’s what Disney’s C.F.O., Christine McCarthy, told analysts this morning:\nWe expect to fully realize roughly $2 billion of cost synergies by 2021.\nAs Andrew reminded earlier this week, “synergies” is a code word for “layoffs.” And Disney executives said that the company expects to start realizing synergies within the first year after the deal closes.\nIt isn’t clear yet how many jobs would be cut if the transaction succeeds, but this would be a rare deal if it actually generated new positions on balance.\n— Michael J. de la Merced\nBut what about Fox’s bid for Sky?\nFox has a bit of unfinished business before it can go forward with its deal with Disney.\nIt’s in the process of seeking regulatory approval in Britain to take full control of the British satellite television giant Sky in a deal worth about $15 billion. The two companies said on Thursday that Fox plans to proceed with the acquisition and hopes to complete the acquisition of the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn’t own by the end of June.\nSky would then be wholly owned by Disney, following the closing of the Fox deal.\nThe context: Mr. Murdoch helped found Sky in the early 1990s and has long sought total ownership of it. He last tried to do so five years ago, but was forced to back off amid the controversy over phone hacking by British tabloids, including the since-shuttered Murdoch-owned News of the World.\nMr. Murdoch’s company had previously said that its existing stake in Sky was “not a natural end position.”\nThe complications: British regulators have been concerned about how much control the Murdoch family would exert over the country’s media and whether Fox, as an entity, would uphold broadcasting standards here.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nIn June, the regulator Ofcom ruled that Rupert Murdoch and other company executives were “fit and proper” to hold broadcasting licenses in Britain, even as it also concluded that a sexual harassment scandal at Fox News had amounted to “significant corporate failures.”\nBritain’s culture minister, Karen Bradly, asked the country’s competition regulator in September to carry out an in-depth review of the Sky transaction. That review is ongoing and provisional findings by the Competition and Markets Authority are expected to be released in January.\nThe official word: “While 21st Century Fox’s existing plans to acquire Sky remain in place, we expect the current investigation to continue,” a spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport said on Thursday.\nThe question: Some analysts have speculated that the British government might be more comfortable with a Sky deal if Disney is the ultimate owner, but whether the Sky deal ultimately received approval remains an open question for now.\n— Chad Bray\nScratch one C.E.O.’s name off a list of presidential contenders.\nAs part of his company’s $52.4 billion deal for Fox, Bob Iger of Disney agreed to renew his contract through 2021 to help complete the merger and integrate the new businesses.\nThat would seem to mean a 2020 presidential run is off the table for Mr. Iger.\nIn March, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Mr. Iger “had told friends he is considering their nudges that he make a run for president in 2020 as a Democrat. “\nThe publication added:\nIger told THR in June that “a lot of people — a lot — have urged me to seek political office” but denied he would consider a run for California governor or senator, positions that historically have served as stepping stones to the White House. However, Iger didn’t specifically address the prospect of a White House run at the time.\nHere are a few other notable business people that are on the list:\n• Howard Schultz of Starbucks\n• Mark Cuban\n• Oprah Winfrey\n• Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook\n— Stephen Grocer\nIs the Fox-Disney really done — or is 21st Century Fox now in play?\nThat’s the question that media executives and Wall Street bankers have been asking this morning.\nCould a digital company like Amazon, Google or Apple emerge with a higher bid? Or Verizon or Comcast?\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nOr could some of them team up to buy the assets and split them among themselves? For example, Comcast has always wanted Fox’s international assets, while any of the digital players would love to own Fox’s content business.\nThe Fox-Disney deal has about a $1.5 billion breakup fee if a higher bid were to emerge. If regulators block the deal, Disney would have to pay about $2.5 billion.\nThe Murdochs’ voting control is worth 39 percent of 21st Century Fox in most situations, except for this: If the company were up for sale, they can only vote their economic stake, which is about 17 percent. And of course, even if the deal is completed as presented today, the next chess piece that will become a point of focus is Hulu given its ownership: Disney would control 60 percent of the service, but Comcast would still own 30 percent and Time Warner owns another 10 percent.\nIt gets complicated quickly.\n— Andrew Ross Sorkin\nOf course ‘The Simpsons’ predicted this deal.\nRyan Parker of The Hollywood Reporter tweeted that one of “The Simpsons” showrunners, Al Jean, told him, “I predict people will make far too much of this mere coincidence.”\nMatt Selman, an executive producer of “The Simpsons,” tweeted this:\nHere’s who helped put the deal together.\nAnd, more important, how some of them will split an estimated fee bounty of up to $154 million.\nFor Disney:\n• Guggenheim Partners\n• JPMorgan Chase\n• Cravath Swaine & Moore\nFor Fox:\n• Goldman Sachs\n• Centerview Partners\n• Deutsche Bank\n• Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom\n• Hogan Lovells\n• Simpson Thacher & Bartlett\nHere’s how much each set of advisers could collect\nAccording to estimates from Freeman & Company:\n• Disney’s bankers could split between $62 million and $71 million.\n• Fox’s bankers could share between $73 million and $83 million.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n— Michael J. de la Merced\nParsing the Disney-Fox announcement.\nHere’s Paul Pendergrass’s take:\nPhoto\nPhoto\nTim Cook and Charles Koch team up to defend Dreamers.\nOne is a tech C.E.O. who has publicly espoused socially liberal initiatives. The other is one of the most prolific and prominent conservative donors around.\nBut Mr. Cook and Mr. Koch have written an op-ed in the WaPo imploring Congress to give “dreamers” — the young immigrants at the center of a fight over illegal immigration — a path to staying in the U.S.\nFrom the piece:\nThis is a political, economic and moral imperative. The sooner that Congress resolves this situation — on a permanent basis — the sooner dreamers can seize the opportunity to plan their lives and develop their talents. This extraordinary set of circumstances has brought the two of us together as co-authors. We are business leaders who sometimes differ on the issues of the day. Yet, on a question as straightforward as this one, we are firmly aligned.\n— Michael J. de la Merced\nThe latest deal to reshape the media landscape is here.\nLet’s break down the Disney deal with Fox that was just announced:\n• Disney will pay about $29.45 a share in an all-stock transaction, buying a big chunk of Fox businesses valued at about $66 billion, including debt.\n• Fox shareholders as a whole will own about 25 percent of The Walt Disney Company.\n• As expected, today’s announcement has no mention of a role for James Murdoch at Disney. That may come down the line as he negotiates with Disney.\n• The Murdochs, who own about 17 percent of existing shares in Fox, will own less than 5 percent of Disney and won’t have any board seats there.\nWhat Robert Iger of Disney has to say\nWe’re honored and grateful that Rupert Murdoch has entrusted us with the future of businesses he spent a lifetime building, and we’re excited about this extraordinary opportunity to significantly increase our portfolio of well-loved franchises and branded content to greatly enhance our growing direct-to-consumer offerings.\nWhat’s at stake: Disney wants to bolster its defenses against Netflix and Amazon. The deal will give the media giant another production studio to pump out content for its forthcoming video streaming service. And Fox’s international broadcasting operations will extend its reach abroad.\nA deeper dive: Ben Thompson of Stratechery takes a look at how effective a response this is to Netflix. He writes, “What has been so impressive over the last few months is the extent and speed with which Disney has seemingly figured it out — and acted accordingly.”\nBehold the (probably) final G.O.P. tax bill.\nIt includes:\n• The corporate tax rate going down to 21 percent,instead of 20 percent\n• The top tax rate going down to 37 percent\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n• A $10,000 deduction that can be split between mortgage payments and state and local taxes\n• A repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, but not the individual A.M.T.\n• The repeal of the individual insurance mandate\n• A preservation of tax breaks for medical expenses and tuition stipends for graduate students\n• A tax deduction for pass-through businesses that largely mirrors the Senate bill’s treatment\nThe cost: still unclear.\nFrom President Trump: “We’re very close to getting it done; we’re very close to voting.”\nThe Senate holdouts: So far, Bob Corker of Tennessee looks likely to again reject the bill on budget deficit grounds. It’s unclear whether Susan Collins of Maine or Marco Rubio are on board after having raised concerns, though neither has raised fresh objections in recent days.\nThe tax flyaround\n• Although Mr. Trump has talked of the tax code drawing companies back to the United States from Ireland, the overhaul may make little difference with investment in the European Union country.

The regulator predicts 2.5 percent growth next year, up from 2.1 percent — but not enough to change the Fed’s plan for three rate increases next year.\nWhen told that the president thinks the Republican tax plan could lead to growth of more than 4 percent, here’s what Ms. Yellen said:\n“I wouldn’t want to rule anything out. It is challenging, however, to achieve growth of the levels that you mentioned.”\nMs. Yellen’s parting comment: “Let me emphasize that correlation is not causation.”\nLooking abroad: Mario Draghi’s final European Central Bank news conference of 2017 is today.

It was a defeat for the prime minister, who wanted more leeway to negotiate with the European Union.\nMs. May is scheduled to be in Brussels for an E.U. Council meeting, where the Europeans are expected to allow Brexit negotiations to proceed to discussions about trade, amid renewed questions about her authority.\nOn top of that, she is under pressure to explain what exactly Britain wants from an E.U. trade relationship, even though she has yet to find a consensus within her own cabinet.\nFrom Jim Brunsden, George Parker and Caroline Binham of the FT:\n“We asked the European side to leave it open for now,” said one of Mrs. May’s allies. “We didn’t want them setting down at this European Council what exactly the parameters of a deal might be.”\nExtra credit: Facebook said that it found no evidence of Russian interference in last year’s Brexit vote.\nPhoto\nThe latest in sexual misconduct news.\n• Salma Hayek described how Harvey Weinstein harassed her, including by trying to shut down her movie, “Frida,” which he co-produced.
