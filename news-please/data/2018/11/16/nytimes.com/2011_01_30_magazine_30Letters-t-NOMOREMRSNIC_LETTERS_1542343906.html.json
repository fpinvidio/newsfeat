Perhaps I’m biased, being a Chinese-American daughter myself, but doesn’t that give me a voice on this issue?\nPerhaps I’m just bitter about my own upbringing; about hearing stories of my friends’ parents’ screaming at them for bringing home 98s and silver medals; about parents’ screaming at their children that they’re useless and embarrassing; about never being good enough. We expect perfection from ourselves and despise ourselves when we don’t get it.\nI realize that it can never hurt to encourage our children to surpass and challenge themselves. But I implore any parent, any reader out there, to consider their children as human beings. Build character, not résumés. Trust in our ability to forge our own paths. We are neither machines nor vehicles for your aspirations. We have feelings and dreams and hopes; give us a chance to follow them.\nANGELA ZHOU\nMarlboro, N.J.\nWarner’s commentary prompted the same question as Amy Chua’s essay in The Wall Street Journal did: Where’s Dad? Parenting is a team sport, and when Mom and Dad share the responsibilities, everybody wins — especially the children.\nDAVID HILL\nMill Valley, Calif.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/magazine/30Letters-t-NOMOREMRSNIC_LETTERS.html"}
