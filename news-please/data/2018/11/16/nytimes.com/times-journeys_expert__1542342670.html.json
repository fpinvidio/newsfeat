Formally, he’s the writer and host of “Myths and Legends,” a weekly podcast started in 2015 that adapts world folklore and mythology for the modern audience. From Hercules to Baba Yaga, King Arthur to Mulan, Osiris to Anansi, and more, Jason taps into his training in English literature, narrative theory, and literary analysis from Ohio State University to narrate new retellings as closely to the originals as possible.\nHe has published more than 100 episodes that have been downloaded over 60 million times worldwide for personal, academic, and professional use. His work has been featured on BuzzFeed, Mental Floss, CBC Radio, multiple conferences, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and beyond. He is also an Academy of Podcasters award nominee for best arts podcast as well as a 2016 Best of iTunes show creator.\nIn 2016, Jason and his wife, Carissa (producer and editor), co-founded the media production company, Bardic, to highlight the art of storytelling. Their third show, Fictional, expands the engaging style of “Myths and Legends” into the world of classical literature.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/times-journeys/expert/jason-weiser/"}
