The last time Mr. Sessions appeared before a Senate committee, during his confirmation hearing in January, he gave false testimony.\n“I did not have communications with the Russians,” Mr. Sessions said in response to a question no one asked — and despite the fact that he had, in fact, met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, at least twice during the 2016 presidential campaign. The omission raised questions not only about his honesty, but also about why he would not disclose those meetings in the first place.\nOn Tuesday Mr. Sessions returned to answer questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian sabotage of the 2016 election and the Trump campaign’s possible ties to those efforts.\nThat was the plan, anyway. In fact — and to the great consternation of the Democratic members of the committee, at least — Mr. Sessions was not on board. He arrived in full body armor, testy and sometimes raising his voice to defend what he called his honor against “scurrilous and false allegations” that he had colluded with Moscow.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/opinion/jeff-sessions-clams-up-in-congress.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
