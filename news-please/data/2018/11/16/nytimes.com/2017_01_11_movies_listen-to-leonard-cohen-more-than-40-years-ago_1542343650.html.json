Back then, the voice that later developed into a forbidding sepulchral drone was closer to the folk croon of Paul Simon.\nMr. Cohen’s attitude in the film, which opens Wednesday, Jan. 18, at Film Forum and was never released theatrically in the United States, is by turns quizzical, amused and courtly. Insecure about his voice, Mr. Cohen lacks all grandiosity and politely endures press interviews. When the sound system breaks down in the middle of a concert in the Netherlands, he is besieged by fans demanding their money back and invites them onstage with him.\nSome of the early classics Mr. Cohen is heard singing are “Avalanche,” “Suzanne,” “Story of Isaac,” “Famous Blue Raincoat” and “So Long, Marianne.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/movies/listen-to-leonard-cohen-more-than-40-years-ago.html"}
