I drink iced coffee when there’s a blizzard outside. So I usually go to L & M Deli on my corner. It’s been there for almost 40 years.

I’m not a big breakfast person.\nCALENDAR I’ll come back home and see what the big events of the day are. In summer there’s usually a lot of parades, especially on Sunday. I read the papers, and then I’m usually scrolling through Twitter.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/nyregion/how-corey-johnson-city-council-speaker-spends-his-sundays.html"}
