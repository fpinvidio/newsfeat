data-description="Robert Philip Hanssen, 56-year-old senior FBI counterintelligence supervisor, is charged as spy who passed highly classified information to Russia for 15 years in return for $1.4 million in cash and diamonds; Hanssen is accused of turning over huge array of secrets, including identities of Russian agents who were subsequently executed; Hanssen is arrested in suburban Virginia park after allegedly dropping off bag of documents, before he could pick up $50,000 in cash left in second park; Dir Louis Freeh says that Hanssen used intimate knowledge of FBI techniques to elude detection, spending hours at office computer checking that he was not under suspicion, which did not occur until last year; Hanssen also did not tell Russians his real name or job, refused face-to-face contact, did not travel abroad and did not have lavish lifestyle; long, detailed affidavit says Hanssen, married father of six who lives in Vienna, Virginia, volunteered to spy in 1985 letter to Soviet embassy official Victor I Cherkashin, and continued, unfazed by tightened security after Aldrich Ames scandal; Cherkashin was also Ames contact; FBI reportedly got Hanssen's file from Russian intelligence, itself a counterintelligence coup; Freeh announces high-level panel under William H Webster to assess damage; Pres Bush and Atty Gen John Ashcroft comment; prosecutors could seek death penalty because of deaths of Russian agents, whom Hanssen named in original letter to prove his credentials; affidavit also shows that Hanssen compromised probe of suspected State Department spy Felix Bloch (M)"

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="308" data-total-count="308">A senior F.B.I. agent who worked as a counterintelligence supervisor at the agency's headquarters was charged today as a spy who passed highly classified information to Russia for 15 years without being detected. Law enforcement officials described the case as an extremely grave breach of national security.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="622">The agent, Robert Philip Hanssen, 56, was accused of turning over to Moscow a huge array of secrets, including the identities of three Russian agents who had been secretly recruited to spy for the United States. Two of the Russians were subsequently tried and executed; the third was imprisoned and later released.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="418" data-total-count="1040">In return, F.B.I. officials said, the Russians paid Mr. Hanssen a total of $1.4 million. The money was paid in  cash, often stacks of $100 bills, delivered in plastic trash bags to clandestine drop-off sites in suburban Virginia, the officials said. Other payments, they said, were made in untraceable diamonds and deposits into a bank account that the Russians told Mr. Hanssen that they had opened for him in Moscow.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="239" data-total-count="1279">He was arrested early Sunday evening in a suburban Virginia park minutes after he had dropped off a bag of classified documents, officials said. A bag containing $50,000 was waiting for him in a hidden location at a nearby park, they said.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="416" data-total-count="1695" id="story-continues-1">The F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh,  suggested today that Mr. Hanssen succeeded in eluding detection for as long as he did because he used his intimate knowledge of the F.B.I.'s counterintelligence techniques and spent hours at his office computer entering his name into classified F.B.I. databanks to determine whether he had fallen under suspicion. Mr. Hanssen was not suspected of espionage until late last year.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-2">Continue reading the main story</a>

        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="342" data-total-count="2037" id="story-continues-3">In addition, officials said, Mr. Hanssen never told the Russians his real name, instead calling himself Ramon. They said he did not identify himself to the Russians as an F.B.I. agent and refused to meet face-to-face with his contacts. He would not travel outside the country to pass information and did not appear to live a lavish lifestyle.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="185" data-total-count="2222">Although the F.B.I.'s internal security personnel have the ability to track each agent's use of F.B.I. computerized crime files, Mr. Hanssen's use of the databases was never questioned.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="282" data-total-count="2504">Mr. Hanssen's arrest confronted the Federal Bureau of Investigation with a serious security lapse and one of its most embarrassing counterintelligence failures in recent years. The bureau is the principal federal agency responsible for ferreting out spies against the United States.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="250" data-total-count="2754">Over the years, Mr. Hanssen received several promotions, rising through the F.B.I.'s counterintelligence ranks even while, officials said, he was secretly supplying the Russians with highly classified data after 1991 when the Soviet empire collapsed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="77" data-total-count="2831">''The trusted insider betrayed his trust without detection,'' Mr. Freeh said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="3167">Plato Cacheris, Mr. Hanssen's lawyer, said that as of now his client would plead not guilty to the charges, but added that the case was still in its early stages. Mr. Cacheris suggested that the government's case might not seem as solid as it appeared, saying that prosecutors ''always talk like they have a great case, but we'll see.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="461" data-total-count="3628">An F.B.I. affidavit filed in support of the charges against Mr. Hanssen, which was unsealed today, said he  began his espionage in 1985 and spied undeterred for the Soviet Union and, after its collapse, for Russia. It said he continued apparently unfazed by the many changes Mr. Freeh imposed to strengthen counterespionage efforts in the aftermath of the case against Aldrich H. Ames, the C.I.A. officer sentenced to life in prison in 1994 as a spy for Moscow.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="429" data-total-count="4057">The affidavit, nearly 100 pages long, provided an unusually detailed narrative account. It included details intended to support the bureau's view that Mr. Hanssen had a long career as a Soviet spy, listing the dates that officials said he had contacts with the Russians, the texts of  letters officials said he wrote to Russian officials, the payments officials said he received and the nature of the material he provided Moscow.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="4280" id="story-continues-4">Law enforcement officials said the F.B.I. had secretly obtained the bulk of Mr. Hanssen's espionage file from the Russian intelligence service, which they said was in itself a counterintelligence coup for the United States.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="240" data-total-count="4520">Mr. Freeh said Mr. Hanssen's arrest was unrelated to the defection last October of Sergei Tretyakov, a Russian diplomat at the United Nations. Later, law enforcement officials said it was not Mr. Tretyakov who cast suspicion on Mr. Hanssen.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="419" data-total-count="4939">Today, Mr. Freeh would not discuss how the F.B.I. learned of Mr. Hanssen's activities or why they had not been discovered sooner. He also  would not say whether Mr. Hanssen had ever been subject to screening procedures like polygraph examination. Lie-detector tests are routinely given to F.B.I. employees who handle highly sensitive information and are authorized to deal with other countries or intelligence agencies.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="377" data-total-count="5316">Mr. Freeh said Mr. Hanssen's activity ''represents the most traitorous actions imaginable.'' He said the F.B.I. had not yet determined the full extent of the damage because agents did not want to risk tipping their hand by beginning such a review while the investigation was under way. Even so, Mr. Freeh said of the suspected damage, ''We believe it was exceptionally grave.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="413" data-total-count="5729">It was evident today that F.B.I. officials were bracing for what they expect to be stinging criticism in the days ahead. Mr. Freeh said his agency had agreed to the appointment of a high-level panel that will assess the extent of the damage and review security procedures at the F.B.I. The panel will be led by William H. Webster, a former director of central intelligence and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="284" data-total-count="6013">As a reflection of the seriousness of the case, President Bush read a statement to reporters traveling with him on Air Force One, saying,  ''This has been a difficult day for those who love our country, especially for those who serve our country in law enforcement and intelligence.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="110" data-total-count="6123">He added, ''To anyone who would betray its trust, I warn you, we'll find you and we'll bring you to justice.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="169" data-total-count="6292">Attorney General John Ashcroft issued a statement that said in part, ''Individuals who commit treasonous acts against the United States will be held fully accountable.''</p><div class="newsletter-signup hidden auto-newsletter variant-1-hidden " id="newsletter-promo" data-newsletter-productCode="" data-newsletter-productTitle="" aria-labeledby="newsletter-promo-heading">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="293" data-total-count="6585">Technically, however, Mr. Hanssen was not charged with treason, but with espionage and conspiracy to commit espionage for allegedly passing classified information to a foreign power. Treason is a separate crime of passing secret military information to a country at war with the United States.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="306" data-total-count="6891" id="story-continues-5">Prosecutors in Mr. Hanssen's case could seek the death penalty because of the deaths of the two Russian agents, in addition to fines of up to $2.8 million, twice the amount he is believed to have received from his spying. Justice Department officials have not said whether they will seek the death penalty.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="236" data-total-count="7127">Mr. Hanssen, a married father of six, has been held in a detention center in Virginia since his arrest at a park near his home in the Washington suburb of Vienna, Va. He was arraigned today in a Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="304" data-total-count="7431">Mr. Freeh was in the F.B.I.'s command center at the agency's headquarters when Mr. Hanssen was arrested as he returned to his car after dropping off a package of classified documents, law enforcement officials said. Mr. Hanssen was ''shocked and surprised,'' Mr. Freeh said, but he did not resist arrest.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="7777">Agents were exultant after the successful arrest, but the mood in the command center quickly turned somber as F.B.I. officials realized that it was one of their own agents who had just been taken into custody. It was Mr. Freeh who proposed the outside inquiry into the F.B.I.'s internal security procedures, a suggestion accepted by Mr. Ashcroft.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="330" data-total-count="8107">Although the accusations against Mr. Hanssen are by far the most serious against an F.B.I. agent, he is not the first agent to be accused of spying. In 1997, Earl Pitts, who was stationed at the F.B.I. Academy in Quantico, Va., was sentenced to 27 years in prison after admitting he spied for Moscow during and after the cold war.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="226" data-total-count="8333">Richard W. Miller, a Los Angeles F.B.I. agent who was caught spying,  was arrested in 1984 and later sentenced to 20 years in prison. His sentenced was reduced to 13 years, and he was released in 1994 after serving nine years.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="8570">Today, the government's affidavit said Mr. Hanssen volunteered to spy for Moscow in October 1985 when he was working as the supervisor of a squad that was responsible for the electronic monitoring of Russians in the vicinity of New York.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="216" data-total-count="8786">He sent a secret letter to Victor I. Cherkashin, the same official at the Russian Embassy in Washington who acted as the contact for Mr. Ames, the career C.I.A. officer who walked into the Soviet Embassy in May 1985.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="9124" id="story-continues-6">In the letter, Mr. Hanssen said he was aware that ''your service has recently suffered some setbacks.'' Then, in an apparent effort to demonstrate that the intelligence he could offer was genuine, he identified Boris Yuzhin, Sergei M. Motorin and Valery F. Martinov, all Russian agents who had been recruited to spy for the United States.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="250" data-total-count="9374">By then, all three had already been identified by Mr. Ames, but by passing these names to the Russians, Mr. Hanssen could be sentenced to death because Mr. Motorin and Mr. Martynov were later convicted in Soviet courts and executed for their actions.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="239" data-total-count="9613">The affidavit appears to clear up what counterintelligence officials have long said was a mystery that had perplexed them since 1989 when a covert investigation began into Felix S. Bloch, a State Department employee suspected of espionage.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="9932">The affidavit said that Mr. Hanssen compromised the investigation by alerting the Russians that the F.B.I. suspected Mr. Bloch of meeting in 1989 with a Soviet agent in Paris and Brussels. As a result, Mr. Bloch denied he had ever engaged in spying and declined to answer any questions and the F.B.I. inquiry collapsed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="202" data-total-count="10134">Mr. Hanssen, whom the Russians referred to only as B, wrote articulate messages to his handlers that reflected his knowledge of spying, his need for anonymity and the risks he faced, the affidavit said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="290" data-total-count="10424">In one message in July 1988, he wrote about his strict precautions to avoid detection. ''My security concerns may seem excessive,'' he wrote. ''I believe experience has shown them to be necessary. I am much safer if you know little about me. Neither of us are children about these things.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="392" data-total-count="10816">Over the years, Mr. Hanssen turned over information about ''dozens of United States government classified documents,'' including some involving the government's double-agent program, a study on K.G.B. recruitment operations against the C.I.A., an analysis of K.G.B. operations and ''a highly classified and tightly restricted analysis of the foreign threat'' to a top-secret American program.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="11141">In addition, the affidavit accused him of compromising electronic surveillance methods. Of Mr. Hanssen's actions, Mr. Freeh said, ''The F.B.I. entrusted him with some of the most sensitive material of the United States government and instead of being humbled by this honor, Hanssen allegedly abused and betrayed that trust.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="11371">Boris N. Labusov, spokesman for Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, said tonight on Russian television, ''There is an old home truth,'' in the intelligence business, ''that intelligence successes become known after a failure.''</p><div id="story-ad-5" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

And there will be disclosures, but I would not call it a usual practice. When a spy scandal is elevated to a political level, it is necessary to understand who and what is behind it, who derives benefits from it.''</p><aside class="story-content subscriptions-module hidden" id="subscriptions-module"></aside><footer class="story-footer story-content">
