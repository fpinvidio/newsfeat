It’s only an inch. An inch wouldn’t have made a difference. You got the yardage. You need to be smart.”\nGaroppolo came to the Niners in a trade with the New England Patriots last season and proceeded to go 5-0 as a starter for a team that had been 1-10. Even though Garoppolo had just seven starts over four seasons, San Francisco locked him up with a huge contract that includes more than $70 million in guaranteed money.\nIt has been an uneven start to this season, with the 49ers going 1-2 thus far, but Garoppolo had his team rolling after an early deficit on Sunday, and had completed 20 of 30 passes for 251 yards and two touchdowns in the game before the injury. In his place, C. J. Beathard had his only pass attempt wiped out by a penalty.\nBeathard, a third-round pick in 2017, went 1-4 as a starter in his rookie season, and Shanahan announced on Monday that he would be the team’s new starting quarterback in what could quickly turn from a year in which San Francisco was expected to compete for a playoff spot to one where the team is a contender for the No. 1 pick in the draft.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/23/sports/football/san-francisco-49ers-jimmy-garoppolo-acl.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
