Her date, Jim Harnden, 55, said a rising tide of leftist politics had left conservative Americans isolated.\n“Young people are always socialists,” Mr. Harnden said. “Women are socialists, too. White men really did build this country, and now they’re a minority.”\nMost of Mrs. Clinton’s supporters believe that life is getting better for people like them, according to studies by the Pew Research Center. The vast majority of Mr. Trump’s supporters do not.\n“No one cares. People are scared,” said Pamela Bojtos Lent, 52, a Democrat from Brownsville, Pa., who cast her vote for Mr. Trump with her children and grandchildren in mind. “As bad as it is now, if it doesn’t go to the flip side, what happens next? They’re all going to work in fast-food restaurants.”\nIn the wake of a campaign that exposed rich seams of misogyny and prejudice marbled through American politics, the prospects for any kind of national harmony looked bleak on Election Day. Most voters said in a New York Times/CBS News poll just before the election that the campaign had left them disgusted. In exit polls Tuesday, the idea of either candidate’s taking office made most voters concerned or scared.\nMany Americans came out to vote against someone, not for someone.\n“I’m down here to vote against Trump,” said Estraya Ingel, a middle-aged blackjack dealer in the Centennial Hills neighborhood of Las Vegas, where the city’s sprawl tapers into the former horse ranches and scrub brush of rural Nevada. A worn brown vinyl purse hung from her left arm, and she stared down at the cracked pavement. The daughter of Mexican immigrants, Ms. Ingel said she had never failed to vote since turning 18.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/us/politics/trump-clinton-supporters.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
