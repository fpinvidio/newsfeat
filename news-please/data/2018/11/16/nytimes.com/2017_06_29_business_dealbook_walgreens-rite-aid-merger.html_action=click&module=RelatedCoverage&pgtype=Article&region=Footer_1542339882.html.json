Standley, Rite Aid’s chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts, using the ticker symbol for Walgreens.\nShares of Rite Aid tumbled as much as 30 percent on Thursday — its steepest plunge since December 2007 — and closed down more than 26 percent.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/business/dealbook/walgreens-rite-aid-merger.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
