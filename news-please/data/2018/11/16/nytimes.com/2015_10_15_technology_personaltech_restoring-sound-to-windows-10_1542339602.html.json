I upgraded my PC laptop to Windows 10 and ever since my computer doesn’t have any sound. How do I get my audio back?\nA. Upgrading a computer from an older version of Windows can sometimes damage the system’s device drivers, including the one for the sound card. To grab a new copy of the driver software, go to the Start menu’s search box, enter Device Manager and open it when it pops up in the results list.\nNext, in the “Sound, video and game controllers” area, look for the name of your computer’s sound card. Depending on your model, you may see hardware from Creative Labs, Intel or another company listed. Click the Driver tab there and choose Update Driver.\nWindows should look around and install a new version of the driver. If the system reports that it cannot find a driver for your sound card, go to the support area of the company’s website and see if there is an updated driver there to download.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/technology/personaltech/restoring-sound-to-windows-10.html"}
