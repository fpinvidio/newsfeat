In a speech last year Mr. Brennan, Mr. Obama’s trusted adviser, said that not a single noncombatant had been killed in a year of strikes. And in a recent interview, a senior administration official said that the number of civilians killed in drone strikes in Pakistan under Mr. Obama was in the “single digits” — and that independent counts of scores or hundreds of civilian deaths unwittingly draw on false propaganda claims by militants.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="367" data-total-count="14199">But in interviews, three former senior intelligence officials expressed disbelief that the number could be so low. The C.I.A. accounting has so troubled some administration officials outside the agency that they have brought their concerns to the White House. One called it “guilt by association” that has led to “deceptive” estimates of civilian casualties.</p><div id="story-ad-6" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

Though Mrs. Clinton strongly supported the strikes, she complained to colleagues about the drones-only approach at Situation Room meetings, in which discussion would focus exclusively on the pros, cons and timing of particular strikes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="432" data-total-count="34231">At their weekly lunch, Mrs. Clinton told the president she thought there should be more attention paid to the root causes of radicalization, and Mr. Obama agreed. But it was September 2011 before he issued an executive order setting up a sophisticated, interagency war room at the State Department to counter the jihadi narrative on an hour-by-hour basis, posting messages and video online and providing talking points to embassies.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="373" data-total-count="34604">Mr. Obama was heartened, aides say, by a letter discovered in the raid on <person idsrc="nyt-per" value="automobiles,business,college,dealbook,dining,education,fashion,garden,giving,health,jobs,magazine,movies,multimedia,nyregion,obituaries,realestate,science,sports,style,technology,theater,travel,us,washington,weekinreview,world:::More articles about Osama bin Laden.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/osama_bin_laden/index.html"><alt-code idsrc="nyt-per" value="bin Laden, Osama"></alt-code>Osama bin Laden</person>’s compound in Pakistan. It complained that the American president had undermined Al Qaeda’s support by repeatedly declaring that the United States was at war not with Islam, but with the terrorist network. “We must be doing a good job,” Mr. Obama told his secretary of state.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="619" data-total-count="35223">Moreover, Mr. Obama’s record has not drawn anything like the sweeping criticism from allies that his predecessor faced. John B. Bellinger III, a top national security lawyer under the Bush administration, said that was because Mr. Obama’s liberal reputation and “softer packaging” have protected him. “After the global outrage over Guantánamo, it’s remarkable that the rest of the world has looked the other way while the Obama administration has conducted hundreds of drone strikes in several different countries, including killing at least some civilians,” said Mr. Bellinger, who supports the strikes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="317" data-total-count="35540">By withdrawing from Iraq and preparing to withdraw from <location code-source="nyt-geo" location-code="world,us,magazine,nyregion,washington:::More news and information about Afghanistan.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/afghanistan/index.html|||travel:::Go to the Afghanistan Travel Guide.:::http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/asia/afghanistan/overview.html" style="Y"><alt-code idsrc="nyt-geo" value="Afghanistan"></alt-code>Afghanistan</location>, Mr. Obama has refocused the fight on Al Qaeda and hugely reduced the death toll both of American soldiers and Muslim civilians. But in moments of reflection, Mr. Obama may have reason to wonder about unfinished business and unintended consequences.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="255" data-total-count="35795">His focus on strikes has made it impossible to forge, for now, the new relationship with the Muslim world that he had envisioned. Both Pakistan and Yemen are arguably less stable and more hostile to the United States than when Mr. Obama became president.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="36069">Justly or not, drones have become a provocative symbol of American power, running roughshod over national sovereignty and killing innocents.

Any damage it does to the national interest only shows up over the long term.”</p><div id="story-ad-15" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="357" data-total-count="36822" id="story-continues-17">But Mr. Blair’s dissent puts him in a small minority of security experts. Mr. Obama’s record has eroded the political perception that Democrats are weak on national security.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="418" data-total-count="37240">Aides say that Mr. Obama’s choices, though, are not surprising. The president’s reliance on strikes, said Mr. Leiter, the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center, “is far from a lurid fascination with covert action and special forces. It’s much more practical. He’s the president. He faces a post-Abdulmutallab situation, where he’s being told people might attack the United States tomorrow.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="104" data-total-count="37344">“You can pass a lot of laws,” Mr. Leiter said, “Those laws are not going to get Bin Laden dead.”</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
