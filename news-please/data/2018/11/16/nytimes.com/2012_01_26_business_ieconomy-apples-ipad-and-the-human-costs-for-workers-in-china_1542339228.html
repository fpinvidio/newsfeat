Foxconn is one of the few manufacturers in the world with the scale to build sufficient numbers of iPhones and iPads.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="421" data-total-count="8971" id="story-continues-6">Factories in Chengdu manufacture products for hundreds of companies. But Mr. Lai was focused on Foxconn Technology, China’s largest exporter and one of the nation’s biggest employers, with 1.2 million workers. The company has plants throughout China, and assembles an estimated 40 percent of the world’s consumer electronics, including for customers like Amazon, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Nintendo, Nokia and Samsung.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="9117">Foxconn’s factory in Chengdu, Mr. Lai knew, was special. Inside, workers were building Apple’s latest, potentially greatest product: the iPad.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="489" data-total-count="9606">When Mr. Lai finally landed a job repairing machines at the plant, one of the first things he noticed were the almost blinding lights. Shifts ran 24 hours a day, and the factory was always bright. At any moment, there were thousands of workers standing on assembly lines or sitting in backless chairs, crouching next to large machinery, or jogging between loading bays. Some workers’ legs swelled so much they waddled. “It’s hard to stand all day,” said Zhao Sheng, a plant worker.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="698" data-total-count="10304">Banners on the walls warned the 120,000 employees: “Work hard on the job today or work hard to find a job tomorrow.” Apple’s supplier code of conduct dictates that, except in unusual circumstances, employees are not supposed to work more than 60 hours a week. But at Foxconn, some worked more, according to interviews, workers’ pay stubs and surveys by outside groups. Mr. Lai was soon spending 12 hours a day, six days a week inside the factory, according to his paychecks. Employees who arrived late were sometimes required to write confession letters and copy quotations. There were “continuous shifts,” when workers were told to work two stretches in a row, according to interviews.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="337" data-total-count="10641">Mr. Lai’s college degree enabled him to earn a salary of around $22 a day, including overtime — more than many others. When his days ended, he would retreat to a small bedroom just big enough for a mattress, wardrobe and a desk where he obsessively played an online game called Fight the Landlord, said his girlfriend, Luo Xiaohong.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="574" data-total-count="11215">Those accommodations were better than many of the company’s dorms, where 70,000 Foxconn workers lived, at times stuffed 20 people to a three-room apartment, employees said. Last year, a dispute over paychecks set off a riot in one of the dormitories, and workers started throwing bottles, trash cans and flaming paper from their windows, according to witnesses. Two hundred police officers wrestled with workers, arresting eight. Afterward, trash cans were removed, and piles of rubbish — and rodents — became a problem. Mr. Lai felt lucky to have a place of his own.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="473" data-total-count="11688">Foxconn, in a statement, disputed workers’ accounts of continuous shifts, extended overtime, crowded living accommodations and the causes of the riot. The company said that its operations adhered to customers’ codes of conduct, industry standards and national laws. “Conditions at Foxconn are anything but harsh,” the company wrote. Foxconn also said that it had never been cited by a customer or government for under-age or overworked employees or toxic exposures.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="12034">“All assembly line employees are given regular breaks, including one-hour lunch breaks,” the company wrote, and only 5 percent of assembly line workers are required to stand to carry out their tasks. Work stations have been designed to ergonomic standards, and employees have opportunities for job rotation and promotion, the statement said.</p><div id="story-ad-5" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="226" data-total-count="12260" id="story-continues-7">“Foxconn has a very good safety record,” the company wrote. “Foxconn has come a long way in our efforts to lead our industry in China in areas such as workplace conditions and the care and treatment of our employees.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="12286"><strong> Apple’s Code of Conduct</strong></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="461" data-total-count="12747">In 2005, some of Apple’s top executives gathered inside their Cupertino, Calif., headquarters for a special meeting. Other companies had created codes of conduct to police their suppliers. It was time, Apple decided, to follow suit. The code Apple published that year demands “that working conditions in Apple’s supply chain are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="421" data-total-count="13168">But the next year, a British newspaper, The Mail on Sunday, <a title="The Mail on Sunday article on Foxconn." href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-401234/The-stark-reality-iPods-Chinese-factories.html">secretly visited a Foxconn factory</a> in <location code-source="nyt-geo" location-code="travel:::Go to the Shenzhen Travel Guide.:::http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/asia/china/shenzhen/overview.html" style="Y"><alt-code idsrc="nyt-geo" value="Shenzhen (China)"></alt-code>Shenzhen</location>, China, where iPods were manufactured, and reported on workers’ long hours, push-ups meted out as punishment and crowded dorms.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="421" data-total-count="13589">Apple audited that factory, the company’s first such inspection, and ordered improvements. Executives also undertook a series of initiatives that included an annual audit report, first published in 2007. By last year, Apple had inspected 396 facilities — including the company’s direct suppliers, as well as many of those suppliers’ suppliers — one of the largest such programs within the electronics industry.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="413" data-total-count="14002">Those audits have found consistent violations of Apple’s code of conduct, <a title="Apple’s reports on its suppliers." href="http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/reports.html">according to summaries</a> published by the company. In 2007, for instance, Apple conducted over three dozen audits, two-thirds of which indicated that employees regularly worked more than 60 hours a week. In addition, there were six “core violations,” the most serious kind, including hiring 15-year-olds as well as falsifying records.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="519" data-total-count="14521">Over the next three years, Apple conducted 312 audits, and every year, about half or more showed evidence of large numbers of employees laboring more than six days a week as well as working extended overtime. Some workers received less than minimum wage or had pay withheld as punishment. Apple found 70 core violations over that period, including cases of involuntary labor, under-age workers, record falsifications, improper disposal of hazardous waste and over a hundred workers injured by toxic chemical exposures.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="515" data-total-count="15036">Last year, the company conducted 229 audits. There were slight improvements in some categories and the detected rate of core violations declined. However, within 93 facilities, at least half of workers exceeded the 60-hours-a-week work limit. At a similar number, employees worked more than six days a week. There were incidents of discrimination, improper safety precautions, failure to pay required overtime rates and other violations. That year, four employees were killed and 77 injured in workplace explosions.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="375" data-total-count="15411">“If you see the same pattern of problems, year after year, that means the company’s ignoring the issue rather than solving it,” said one former Apple executive with firsthand knowledge of the supplier responsibility group. “Noncompliance is tolerated, as long as the suppliers promise to try harder next time. If we meant business, core violations would disappear.”</p><div id="story-ad-6" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="15682" id="story-continues-8">Apple says that when an audit reveals a violation, the company requires suppliers to address the problem within 90 days and make changes to prevent a recurrence. “If a supplier is unwilling to change, we terminate our relationship,” <a title="Apple’s page on supplier audits." href="http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/auditing.html">the company says</a> on its Web site.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="15903">The seriousness of that threat, however, is unclear. Apple has found violations in hundreds of audits, but fewer than 15 suppliers have been terminated for transgressions since 2007, according to former Apple executives.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="490" data-total-count="16393">“Once the deal is set and Foxconn becomes an authorized Apple supplier, Apple will no longer give any attention to worker conditions or anything that is irrelevant to its products,” said Mr. Li, the former Foxconn manager. Mr. Li spent seven years with Foxconn in Shenzhen and Chengdu and was forced out in April after he objected to a relocation to Chengdu, he said. Foxconn disputed his comments, and said “both Foxconn and Apple take the welfare of our employees very seriously.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="377" data-total-count="16770">Apple’s efforts have spurred some changes. Facilities that were reaudited “showed continued performance improvements and better working conditions,” the company wrote in its <a title="The 2011 progress report (PDF)." href="http://images.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/pdf/Apple_SR_2011_Progress_Report.pdf">2011 supplier responsibility progress report</a>. In addition, the number of audited facilities has grown every year, and some executives say those expanding efforts obscure year-to-year improvements.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="430" data-total-count="17200">Apple also has trained over a million workers about their rights and methods for injury and disease prevention. A few years ago, after auditors insisted on interviewing low-level factory employees, they discovered that some had been forced to pay onerous “recruitment fees” — which Apple classifies as involuntary labor. As of last year, the company had forced suppliers to reimburse more than $6.7 million in such charges.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="17424">“Apple is a leader in preventing under-age labor,” said Dionne Harrison of Impactt, a firm paid by Apple to help prevent and respond to <classifier idsrc="nyt-classifier" class="Topic" type="Topic" value="automobiles,business,college,dealbook,dining,education,fashion,garden,giving,health,jobs,magazine,movies,multimedia,nyregion,obituaries,realestate,science,sports,style,technology,theater,travel,us,washington,weekinreview,world:::More articles about child labor.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/child_labor/index.html"><alt-code idsrc="nyt-classifier" value="Child Labor"></alt-code>child labor</classifier> among its suppliers. “They’re doing as much as they possibly can.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="27" data-total-count="17451">Other consultants disagree.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="335" data-total-count="17786">“We’ve spent years telling Apple there are serious problems and recommending changes,” said a consultant at BSR — also known as Business for Social Responsibility — which has been twice retained by Apple to provide advice on labor issues. “They don’t want to pre-empt problems, they just want to avoid embarrassments.”</p><div class="newsletter-signup hidden auto-newsletter variant-1-hidden " id="newsletter-promo" data-newsletter-productCode="" data-newsletter-productTitle="" aria-labeledby="newsletter-promo-heading">

Foxconn asked participants to sign agreements saying they would not disclose what they observed, and then rewrote those agreements multiple times. Finally, an agreement was struck, and the project was scheduled to begin in January 2008. A day before the start, Foxconn demanded more changes, until it was clear the project would not proceed, according to the consultant and a 2008 summary by BSR that did not name Foxconn.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="444" data-total-count="19566">The next year, a Foxconn employee fell or jumped from an apartment building after losing an iPhone prototype.

I’ve never heard from anyone from Apple at all.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="441" data-total-count="26348">The morning of the explosion, Mr. Lai rode his bicycle to work. The iPad had gone on sale just weeks earlier, and workers were told thousands of cases needed to be polished each day. The factory was frantic, employees said.

Over 90 percent of his body had been seared. “My mom ran away from the room at the first sight of him. I cried. Nobody could stand it,” his brother said. When his mother eventually returned, she tried to avoid touching her son, for fear that it would cause pain.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="93" data-total-count="27496">“If I had known,” she said, “I would have grabbed his arm, I would have touched him.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="65" data-total-count="27561">“He was very tough,” she said. “He held on for two days.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="147" data-total-count="27708">After Mr. Lai died, Foxconn workers drove to Mr. Lai’s hometown and delivered a box of ashes.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="300" data-total-count="28790" id="story-continues-13">In December, however, seven months after the blast that killed Mr. Lai, another iPad factory exploded, this one in <location code-source="nyt-geo" location-code="travel:::Go to the Shanghai Travel Guide.:::http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/asia/china/shanghai/overview.html" style="Y"><alt-code idsrc="nyt-geo" value="Shanghai (China)"></alt-code>Shanghai</location>. Once again, aluminum dust was the cause, according to interviews and Apple’s most recent supplier responsibility report. That blast injured 59 workers, with 23 hospitalized.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="423" data-total-count="29213">“It is gross negligence, after an explosion occurs, not to realize that every factory should be inspected,” said Nicholas Ashford, the occupational safety expert, who is now at the <org idsrc="nyt-org" value="automobiles,business,college,dealbook,dining,education,fashion,garden,giving,health,jobs,magazine,movies,multimedia,nyregion,obituaries,realestate,science,sports,style,technology,theater,travel,us,washington,weekinreview,world:::More articles about the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/massachusetts_institute_of_technology/index.html"><alt-code idsrc="nyt-org" value="Massachusetts Institute of Technology"></alt-code>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</org>. “If it were terribly difficult to deal with aluminum dust, I would understand. But do you know how easy dust is to control? It’s called ventilation. We solved this problem over a century ago.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="445" data-total-count="29658">In its most recent supplier responsibility report, Apple wrote that while the explosions both involved combustible aluminum dust, the causes were different. The company declined, however, to provide details. The report added that Apple had now audited all suppliers polishing aluminum products and had put stronger precautions in place. All suppliers have initiated required countermeasures, except one, which remains shut down, the report said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="204" data-total-count="29862">For Mr. Lai’s family, questions remain. “We’re really not sure why he died,” said Mr. Lai’s mother, standing beside a shrine she built near their home. “We don’t understand what happened.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="29888"><strong> Hitting the Apple Lottery</strong></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="485" data-total-count="30373">Every year, as rumors about Apple’s forthcoming products start to emerge, trade publications and Web sites begin speculating about which suppliers are likely to win the Apple lottery. Getting a contract from Apple can lift a company’s value by millions because of the implied endorsement of manufacturing quality. But few companies openly brag about the work: Apple generally requires suppliers to sign contracts promising they will not divulge anything, including the partnership.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="190" data-total-count="30563">That lack of transparency gives Apple an edge at keeping its plans secret. But it also has been a barrier to improving working conditions, according to advocates and former Apple executives.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="30865">This month, after numerous requests by advocacy and news organizations, including The New York Times, <a title="The Times article on the suppliers." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/14/technology/apple-releases-list-of-its-suppliers-for-the-first-time.html">Apple released</a> the names of 156 of its suppliers. In the report accompanying that list, Apple said they “account for more than 97 percent of what we pay to suppliers to manufacture our products.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="420" data-total-count="31285">However, the company has not revealed the names of hundreds of other companies that do not directly contract with Apple, but supply the suppliers. The company’s supplier list does not disclose where factories are, and many are hard to find. And independent monitoring organizations say when they have tried to inspect Apple’s suppliers, they have been barred from entry — on Apple’s orders, they have been told.</p><div id="story-ad-12" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="434" data-total-count="31719" id="story-continues-14">“We’ve had this conversation hundreds of times,” said a former executive in Apple’s supplier responsibility group. “There is a genuine, companywide commitment to the code of conduct. But taking it to the next level and creating real change conflicts with secrecy and business goals, and so there’s only so far we can go.” Former Apple employees say they were generally prohibited from engaging with most outside groups.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="31820">“There’s a real culture of secrecy here that influences everything,” the former executive said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="53" data-total-count="31873">Some other technology companies operate differently.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="194" data-total-count="32067">“We talk to a lot of outsiders,” said Gary Niekerk, director of corporate citizenship at Intel. “The world’s complex, and unless we’re dialoguing with outside groups, we miss a lot.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="373" data-total-count="32440">Given Apple’s prominence and leadership in global manufacturing, if the company were to radically change its ways, it could overhaul how business is done. “Every company wants to be Apple,” said Sasha Lezhnev at the Enough Project, a group focused on corporate accountability. “If they committed to building a conflict-free iPhone, it would transform technology.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="436" data-total-count="32876">But ultimately, say former Apple executives, there are few real outside pressures for change. Apple is one of the most admired brands. In a national survey conducted by The New York Times in November, 56 percent of respondents said they couldn’t think of anything negative about Apple. Fourteen percent said the worst thing about the company was that its products were too expensive. Just 2 percent mentioned overseas labor practices.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="33179">People like Ms. White of Harvard say that until consumers demand better conditions in overseas factories — as they did for companies like Nike and Gap, which today have overhauled conditions among suppliers — or regulators act, there is little impetus for radical change. Some Apple insiders agree.</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">
