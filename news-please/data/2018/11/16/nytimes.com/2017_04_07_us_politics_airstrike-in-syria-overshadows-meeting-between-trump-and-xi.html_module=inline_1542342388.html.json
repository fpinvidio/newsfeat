Mr. Trump repeated his warning that if China did not do more, the United States would act on its own to constrain the belligerent actions of North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un.\nThe president also brought up the chronic trade imbalance between China and the United States. A senior administration official said Mr. Trump had told Mr. Xi that the two sides needed to begin addressing that deficit immediately, prompting China to propose a 100-day plan to overhaul the trade relationship between the world’s largest economies.\nSecretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said Mr. Trump had told the Chinese leader that there needed to be “concrete steps to level the playing field for American workers.” A second senior administration official said the tone in the one-on-one exchanges on trade had been “tough,” though he said there was chemistry between the two men.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/politics/airstrike-in-syria-overshadows-meeting-between-trump-and-xi.html?module=inline"}
