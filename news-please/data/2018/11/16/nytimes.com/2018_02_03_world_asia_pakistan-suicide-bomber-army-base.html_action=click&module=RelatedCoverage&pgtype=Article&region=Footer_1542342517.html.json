The powerful explosion, which rocked the surrounding area, occurred in the Kabal region of Swat, a picturesque valley in the northern part of the country.\nThis was the first major terrorist attack in Swat, once a Taliban stronghold, in the past five years, local residents said. The Pakistani military wrested the region from the Taliban in 2009 and has maintained a heavy presence.\nThe suicide bomber struck Saturday evening while the soldiers were playing volleyball after duty. Officials said they imposed a curfew, cordoned off most local roads and searched for accomplices in the aftermath.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/world/asia/pakistan-suicide-bomber-army-base.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
