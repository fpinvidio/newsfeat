Strom Thurmond ran for the presidency as a segregationist, into the civil rights era in the ’60s, when South Carolina reacted to a Supreme Court decision that struck down segregation on public transportation by embracing Jim Crow more tightly and lifting the Confederate flag to a place of pride above the state house.\nThis week, a survey released by Public Policy Polling suggests that South Carolina’s segregationist nostalgia has accrued to the benefit of Donald Trump, the race-baiting front-runner in Saturday’s primary. First, the poll found that 70 percent of likely Trump voters believe that the flag should still be flying over the state capitol. And a plurality of Mr. Trump’s supporters wish that the South had won the Civil War.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/20/opinion/south-carolinas-legacy-exploited-by-trump.html?module=inline"}
