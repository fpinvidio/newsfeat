Comey has told associates, the F.B.I. director was summoned to the White House for a one-on-one dinner with the new commander in chief.\nThe conversation that night in January, Mr. Comey now believes, was a harbinger of his downfall this week as head of the F.B.I., according to two people who have heard his account of the dinner.\nAs they ate, the president and Mr. Comey made small talk about the election and the crowd sizes at Mr. Trump’s rallies.
