Passengers and baggage are randomly searched at some of the major rail hubs, such as Union Station in Washington and Pennsylvania Station in New York.\n“Passengers failing to consent to security procedures will be denied access to trains,” Christina E. Leeds, an Amtrak spokeswoman, said in an email Saturday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/us/train-attack-in-europe-puts-focus-on-vulnerability-of-us-rail.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
