Funerals for 24 of the victims were held Thursday in Malta, but few of the migrants’ bodies have been recovered.\nMigrants from Africa and the Middle East, buffeted by war and abetted by ruthless smugglers, have been crossing the Mediterranean in increasing numbers in unseaworthy boats. Many never make it.\nLeaders’ efforts to formulate a response are hindered by intense budget pressures, a patchwork of migration policies across the 28-member European Union and a simmering backlash against immigrants across the Continent.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/world/europe/european-union-migration.html?module=inline"}
