It was North Korea’s longest-ever test flight of a ballistic missile.\nThe North has confirmed that the missile was an intermediate-range Hwasong-12, the same model it launched in a test over Japan last month.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/16/world/asia/north-korea-kim-jong-un-missiles.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
