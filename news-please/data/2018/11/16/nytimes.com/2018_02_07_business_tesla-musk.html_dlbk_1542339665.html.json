A day later, he and his car company came back to earth.\nThe electric-car maker said Wednesday that it lost more than three-quarters of a billion dollars in the fourth quarter as it scrambled to root out glitches from its manufacturing operations and ramp up production of its highly anticipated Model 3 sedan.\nIn a conference call with analysts, Mr. Musk, the chief executive, acknowledged that Tesla still faced challenges in putting the Model 3 into mass production. “We were in a deeper level of hell than we expected, still a few levels deeper than we would like to be,” he said.\nThe company reported a quarterly net loss of $771 million, more than tripling the loss it reported for the same period a year earlier. Revenue increased 44 percent to $3.3 billion, on rising sales of its Model S luxury sedan and Model X, a sport-utility vehicle.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/business/tesla-musk.html?dlbk"}
