Across the web, commentators have been aggressive in questioning not only Mr. Williams’s reporting but NBC’s handling of the problem. Some military veterans and commentators have called for his resignation.\nExecutives canceled external meetings and said that the issue was absorbing all of their focus, people in the news division said. Current and former NBC employees discussed the ultimate fate of the news anchor, shocked by his fall from grace and the turmoil it had created at the network.\nMr. Williams has not addressed the issue publicly since Wednesday, when he apologized on his newscast for embellishing an account of an incident in 2003; over the years he came to say that he was in a helicopter that was hit by enemy fire, an assertion he now says is not true. On his newscasts Thursday and Friday, he did not mention the controversy.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/business/media/brian-williams-helicopter-incident-in-iraq.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
