It was spotted just after 2 a.m. and swiftly destroyed the sports hall, which had been prepared to serve as temporary housing for about 100 migrants, the authorities said. No one was injured in the fire.\nOfficials throughout the country have scrambled to find or adapt decent places to shelter new arrivals in Germany, where the struggle to stop anti-immigrant violence has vied for headlines with a mass migration not seen in Europe since the wars that ripped apart Yugoslavia in the 1990s.\nThe United Nations refugee agency said it expected about 3,000 people to cross into Macedonia every day from Greece, the first European Union nation they reach in their flight from conflict and deprivation in the Middle East and beyond.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/world/europe/migrant-crisis-europe-un.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
