The game — in which players try to capture exotic monsters from Pokémon, the Japanese cartoon franchise — uses a combination of ordinary technologies built into smartphones, including location tracking and cameras, to encourage people to visit public landmarks, seeking virtual loot and collectible characters that they try to nab.\nBoon Sheridan, a resident of Holyoke, Mass., has seen the activity firsthand. His home, a converted gable-roofed church that once attracted worshipers, had without his knowledge been designated a Pokémon “gym,” a place where players who reach Level 5 in the game must go to train their Pokémon characters. In the last week, as the game became the most downloaded and top grossing app, he has been wondering how to explain to neighbors all the people who congregated on the sidewalk and pulled up at odd hours.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/technology/pokemon-go-brings-augmented-reality-to-a-mass-audience.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
