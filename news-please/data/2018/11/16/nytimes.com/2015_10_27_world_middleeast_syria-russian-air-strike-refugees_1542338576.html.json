They found a car to drive them out of the area, but ran into snipers and more shelling on the road. The family rented a hut on a farm and were waiting there, dreading the arrival of government troops.\nIt was at least the second time that they had been forced from their home in four years, said Umm Suleiman, who is expecting her fifth child. “All we want is for someone to look with mercy upon us,” she said.\nHer family, though, was unlikely to receive help anytime soon. Roughly five million Syrians in similar circumstances are already living in areas that are considered difficult to reach by relief workers, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Nearly half a million of those are in areas that are besieged by fighting, living on either side of the front lines, according to Pawel Krzysiek, a Red Cross spokesman in the Syrian capital, Damascus.\nEven before the latest upsurge in violence, life had become significantly more desperate this year in Syria, with two-thirds of the country’s 18 million people in dire need of humanitarian aid, according to the Red Cross. For those who are internally displaced, roughly eight million people, the decision to stay in Syria was becoming increasingly untenable. Prices of basic goods inside the country, for instance, have risen 30 percent since the beginning of the year, Mr. Krzysiek said.\nRae McGrath, the Turkey and northern Syria country director for the charity Mercy Corps, said that it was becoming harder and harder for people to secure food in places like Aleppo Province because of the sustained intensity of the fighting among the government, the rebel groups and the Islamic State.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/world/middleeast/syria-russian-air-strike-refugees.html"}
