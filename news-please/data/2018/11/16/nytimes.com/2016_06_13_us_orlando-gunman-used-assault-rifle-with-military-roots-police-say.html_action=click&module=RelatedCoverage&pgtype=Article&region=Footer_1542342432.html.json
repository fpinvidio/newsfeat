Such questions are politically contentious, although depending on a shooter’s skill and the situation, they can sometimes be moot, as aimed semiautomatic fire from a competent shooter can be far more dangerous than automatic fire, which is harder to control and is often inaccurate.\nAR-15s that fire only on semiautomatic are generally legal in the United States, and are widely owned by assault-rifle enthusiasts. They are also sometimes used in crimes, and have been involved in some of the most deadly mass shootings in American history, including the massacre in December in San Bernardino, Calif., which killed 14 people, and the attack in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., which killed 26 people, 20 of them children. (That gunman also killed his mother at home before driving to the school.)\nThe AR-15’s once unfamiliar caliber — commonly called 5.56-millimeter — also evolved into a military standard. The rifle-and-cartridge combination can cause serious wounds, though the damage is determined partly by the type of bullet fired.\nInvestigators in Orlando have yet to provide details on the bullets that were fired in the attack.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/13/us/orlando-gunman-used-assault-rifle-with-military-roots-police-say.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
