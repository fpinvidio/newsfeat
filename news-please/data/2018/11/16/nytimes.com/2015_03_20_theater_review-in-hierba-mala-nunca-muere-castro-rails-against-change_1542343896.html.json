The old bird is Fidel Castro, and the thorn in his increasingly feeble side is President Obama, whose efforts to normalize relations have his head spinning.\nImage From left, Idalmis García, Sandor Juan and Germán Jaramillo in \"Hierba Mala Nunca Muere.\" Credit Michael Palma\nIt’s spinning so much, in fact, that he barely realizes two people in his hospital room are debating how best to kill him.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/theater/review-in-hierba-mala-nunca-muere-castro-rails-against-change.html"}
