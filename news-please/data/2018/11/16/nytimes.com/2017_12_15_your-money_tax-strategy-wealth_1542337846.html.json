Why wait? Because taxpayers will be no worse off than they are today, and could be better off if a new tax code is enacted.\nLast week, I wrote about the tax strategies that affluent people might want to undertake before the end of the year. These included paying property taxes and state taxes early for taxpayers who have not set off the alternative minimum tax, making large charitable gifts or filling a donor-advised fund, and harvesting stock losses because of a potential tax change about how different blocks of stock can be sold.\nThis week, I look at the strategies that could be important next year if the tax overhaul shakes out the way advisers believe it will.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/your-money/tax-strategy-wealth.html"}
