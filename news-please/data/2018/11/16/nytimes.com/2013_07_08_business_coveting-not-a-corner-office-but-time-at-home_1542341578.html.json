Already she has been raising her hand to travel more for trade shows and conferences; last year she made four trips.\nBut probably the career move she is proudest of — and the one she advocates the most — is asking her boss to let her work from home on Fridays.\n“People have said to me, ‘It’s not fair that you get to work from home! I want to work from home,’ ” she said. “And I say, ‘Well, have you asked?’ And they’re like, ‘No, no, I could never do that. My boss would never go for it.’ So I say, ‘Well you should ask, and you shouldn’t hold it against me that I did.’ ”\nNot everyone aspires to be an executive at Facebook, like Ms. Sandberg, or to set foreign policy, like Anne-Marie Slaughter (a former State Department official and another prominent commentator on what’s holding women back in the workplace), especially when the children are young. Unaccounted for in the latest books offering leadership strategies by and for elite women is the fact that only 37 percent of working women (and 44 percent of working men) say they actually want a job with more responsibilities, according to a survey from the Families and Work Institute. And among all mothers with children under 18, just a quarter say they would choose full-time work if money were no object and they were free to do whatever they wanted, according to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll.\nBy comparison, about half of mothers in the United States are actually working full time, indicating that there are a lot out there logging many more hours than they want to be.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/business/coveting-not-a-corner-office-but-time-at-home.html"}
