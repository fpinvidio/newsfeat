She handed me a jacket. “<em>Baka malamig doon</em>” were among the few words she said. (“It might be cold there.”) When I arrived at the <location style="Y" location-code="world:::More news and information about Philippines.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/philippines/index.html|||travel:::Go to the Philippines Travel Guide.:::http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/asia/philippines/overview.html" code-source="nyt-geo"><alt-code value="Philippines" idsrc="nyt-geo"></alt-code>Philippines</location>’ Ninoy Aquino International Airport with her, my aunt and a family friend, I was introduced to a man I’d never seen. They told me he was my uncle. He held my hand as I boarded an airplane for the first time. It was 1993, and I was 12.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="749" data-total-count="1218">My mother wanted to give me a better life, so she sent me thousands of miles away to live with her parents in America — my grandfather (<em>Lolo</em> in Tagalog) and grandmother (<em><classifier class="Restaurant" idsrc="nyt-classifier" type="Venue" value="travel::::::http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/washington/seattle/57520/lola/restaurant-detail.html"><alt-code value="Lola" idsrc="nyt-classifier"></alt-code>Lola</classifier></em>). After I arrived in Mountain View, Calif., in the San Francisco Bay Area, I entered sixth grade and quickly grew to love my new home, family and culture. I discovered a passion for language, though it was hard to learn the difference between formal English and American slang. One of my early memories is of a freckled kid in middle school asking me, “What’s up?” I replied, “The sky,” and he and a couple of other kids laughed. I won the eighth-grade spelling bee by memorizing words I couldn’t properly pronounce. (The winning word was “indefatigable.”)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="345" data-total-count="1563">One day when I was 16, I rode my <classifier class="Topic" idsrc="nyt-classifier" type="Topic" value="travel::::::http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/biking/overview.html"><alt-code value="Bicycles and Bicycling" idsrc="nyt-classifier"></alt-code>bike</classifier> to the nearby D.M.V. office to get my driver’s permit. Some of my friends already had their licenses, so I figured it was time. But when I handed the clerk my green card as proof of U.S. residency, she flipped it around, examining it. “This is fake,” she whispered. “Don’t come back here again.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="713" data-total-count="2276">Confused and scared, I pedaled home and confronted Lolo. I remember him sitting in the garage, cutting coupons. I dropped my bike and ran over to him, showing him the green card. “<em>Peke ba ito</em>?” I asked in Tagalog. (“Is this fake?”) My grandparents were naturalized American citizens — he worked as a security guard, she as a food server — and they had begun supporting my mother and me financially when I was 3, after my father’s wandering eye and inability to properly provide for us led to my parents’ separation. Lolo was a proud man, and I saw the shame on his face as he told me he purchased the card, along with other fake documents, for me. “Don’t show it to other people,” he warned.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

Over the past 14 years, I’ve graduated from high school and college and built a career as a journalist, interviewing some of the most famous people in the country. On the surface, I’ve created a good life. I’ve lived the American dream.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="595" data-total-count="3335">But I am still an undocumented immigrant. And that means living a different kind of reality. It means going about my day in fear of being found out. It means rarely trusting people, even those closest to me, with who I really am. It means keeping my family photos in a shoebox rather than displaying them on shelves in my home, so friends don’t ask about them. It means reluctantly, even painfully, doing things I know are wrong and unlawful. And it has meant relying on a sort of 21st-century underground railroad of supporters, people who took an interest in my future and took risks for me.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="420" data-total-count="3755">Last year I read about four students who walked from <location style="Y" location-code="travel:::Go to the Miami Travel Guide.:::http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/florida/miami/overview.html|||realestate::::::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/south-florida/index.html" code-source="nyt-geo"><alt-code value="Miami (Fla)" idsrc="nyt-geo"></alt-code>Miami</location> to <location style="Y" location-code="travel:::Go to the Washington Travel Guide.:::http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/washington/overview.html" code-source="nyt-geo"><alt-code value="Washington (State)" idsrc="nyt-geo"></alt-code>Washington</location> to lobby for the Dream Act, a nearly decade-old <classifier class="Topic" idsrc="nyt-classifier" type="Topic" value="business,nyregion,us,washington,weekinreview,world:::More articles about immigration.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/immigration_and_refugees/index.html"><alt-code value="Immigration" idsrc="nyt-classifier"></alt-code>immigration</classifier> bill that would provide a path to legal permanent residency for young people who have been educated in this country.

We’re not always who you think we are. Some pick your strawberries or care for your children. Some are in high school or college. And some, it turns out, write news articles you might read. I grew up here. This is my home. Yet even though I think of myself as an American and consider America my country, my country doesn’t think of me as one of its own.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="2" data-total-count="4197"> </p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="774" data-total-count="4971"><strong>My first challenge</strong> was the language. Though I learned English in the Philippines, I wanted to lose my accent. During high school, I spent hours at a time watching television (especially “Frasier,” “Home Improvement” and reruns of “The Golden Girls”) and movies (from “<object.title idsrc="nyt_ttl" class="Movie" value="20351"><alt-code value="Goodfellas" idsrc="nyt_ttl"></alt-code>Goodfellas</object.title>” to “<object.title idsrc="nyt_ttl" class="Movie" value="350778;2540;2541;83771"><alt-code value="Anne of Green Gables" idsrc="nyt_ttl"></alt-code>Anne of Green Gables</object.title>”), pausing the VHS to try to copy how various characters enunciated their words. At the local library, I read magazines, books and newspapers — anything to learn how to write better. Kathy Dewar, my high-school English teacher, introduced me to journalism. From the moment I wrote my first article for the student paper, I convinced myself that having my name in print — writing in English, interviewing Americans — validated my presence here.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="615" data-total-count="5586">The debates over “illegal aliens” intensified my anxieties. In 1994, only a year after my flight from the Philippines, Gov. <person idsrc="nyt-per" value="automobiles,business,college,dealbook,dining,education,fashion,garden,giving,health,jobs,magazine,movies,multimedia,nyregion,obituaries,realestate,science,sports,style,technology,theater,travel,us,washington,weekinreview,world:::More articles about Pete Wilson.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/pete_wilson/index.html"><alt-code value="Wilson, Pete" idsrc="nyt-per"></alt-code>Pete Wilson</person> was re-elected in part because of his support for Proposition 187, which prohibited undocumented immigrants from attending public school and accessing other services. (A federal court later found the law unconstitutional.) After my encounter at the D.M.V. in 1997, I grew more aware of anti-immigrant sentiments and stereotypes: <em>they don’t want to assimilate, they are a drain on society. </em>They’re not talking about me, I would tell myself. I have something to contribute.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="822" data-total-count="6408">To do that, I had to work — and for that, I needed a <classifier class="Topic" idsrc="nyt-classifier" type="Topic" value="automobiles,business,college,dealbook,dining,education,fashion,garden,giving,health,jobs,magazine,movies,multimedia,nyregion,obituaries,realestate,science,sports,style,technology,theater,travel,us,washington,weekinreview,world:::More articles about Social Security.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/social_security_us/index.html"><alt-code value="Social Security" idsrc="nyt-classifier"></alt-code>Social Security</classifier> number. Fortunately, my grandfather had already managed to get one for me. Lolo had always taken care of everyone in the family. He and my grandmother emigrated legally in 1984 from Zambales, a province in the Philippines of rice fields and bamboo houses­, following Lolo’s sister, who married a Filipino-American serving in the American military. She petitioned for her brother and his wife to join her. When they got here, Lolo petitioned for his two children — my mother and her younger brother — to follow them. But instead of mentioning that my mother was a married woman, he listed her as single. Legal residents can’t petition for their married children. Besides, Lolo didn’t care for my father. He didn’t want him coming here too.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="493" data-total-count="6901" id="story-continues-4">But soon Lolo grew nervous that the immigration authorities reviewing the petition would discover my mother was married, thus derailing not only her chances of coming here but those of my uncle as well. So he withdrew her petition. After my uncle came to America legally in 1991, Lolo tried to get my mother here through a tourist visa, but she wasn’t able to obtain one. That’s when she decided to send me. My mother told me later that she figured she would follow me soon. She never did.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="549" data-total-count="7450">The “uncle” who brought me here turned out to be a coyote, not a relative, my grandfather later explained. Lolo scraped together enough money — I eventually learned it was $4,500, a huge sum for him — to pay him to smuggle me here under a fake name and fake passport. (I never saw the passport again after the flight and have always assumed that the coyote kept it.) After I arrived in America, Lolo obtained a new fake Filipino passport, in my real name this time, adorned with a fake student visa, in addition to the fraudulent green card.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="309" data-total-count="7759">Using the fake passport, we went to the local <org idsrc="nyt-org" value="automobiles,business,college,dealbook,dining,education,fashion,garden,giving,health,jobs,magazine,movies,multimedia,nyregion,obituaries,realestate,science,sports,style,technology,theater,travel,us,washington,weekinreview,world:::More articles about Social Security Administration:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/social_security_administration/index.html"><alt-code value="Social Security Administration" idsrc="nyt-org"></alt-code>Social Security Administration</org> office and applied for a Social Security number and card. It was, I remember, a quick visit. When the card came in the mail, it had my full, real name, but it also clearly stated: “Valid for work only with I.N.S. authorization.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="361" data-total-count="8120">When I began looking for work, a short time after the D.M.V. incident, my grandfather and I took the Social Security card to Kinko’s, where he covered the “I.N.S. authorization” text with a sliver of white tape. We then made photocopies of the card. At a glance, at least, the copies would look like copies of a regular, unrestricted Social Security card.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="8458">Lolo always imagined I would work the kind of low-paying jobs that undocumented people often take. (Once I married an American, he said, I would get my real papers, and everything would be fine.) But even menial jobs require documents, so he and I hoped the doctored card would work for now. The more documents I had, he said, the better.</p><figure id="media-100000000875065" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000000875065" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/06/26/magazine/26illegal2/26illegal2-jumbo.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

I was elected to represent my school at school-board meetings, which gave me the chance to meet and befriend Rich Fischer, the superintendent for our school district. I joined the speech and debate team, acted in school plays and eventually became co-editor of The Oracle, the student newspaper. That drew the attention of my principal, Pat Hyland. “You’re at school just as much as I am,” she told me.

Though we eventually reconciled, I had disappointed him on two fronts. First, as a Catholic, he considered homosexuality a sin and was embarrassed about having “<em>ang apo na bakla</em>” (“a grandson who is gay”). Even worse, I was making matters more difficult for myself, he said. I needed to marry an American woman in order to gain a green card.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="141" data-total-count="11952">Tough as it was, coming out about being gay seemed less daunting than coming out about my legal status.

Eventually they connected me to a new scholarship fund for high-potential students who were usually the first in their families to attend college. Most important, the fund was not concerned with immigration status.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="15337">And I did. For the summer of 2003, I applied for internships across the country. Several newspapers, including The <org idsrc="nyt-org" value="nosection:::More articles about the Wall Street Journal.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/wall_street_journal/index.html"><alt-code value="Wall Street Journal" idsrc="nyt-org"></alt-code>Wall Street Journal</org>, <org idsrc="nyt-org" value="automobiles,business,college,dealbook,dining,education,fashion,garden,giving,health,jobs,magazine,movies,multimedia,nyregion,obituaries,realestate,science,sports,style,technology,theater,travel,us,washington,weekinreview,world:::More articles about The Boston Globe.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/b/the_boston_globe/index.html"><alt-code value="Boston Globe" idsrc="nyt-org"></alt-code>The Boston Globe</org> and The Chicago Tribune, expressed interest.

And this time, I had no intention of acknowledging my “problem.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="15673">The Post internship posed a tricky obstacle: It required a driver’s license.

Pat, Rich and Rich’s longtime assistant, Mary Moore, sent letters to me at that address. Rich taught me how to do three-point turns in a parking lot, and a friend accompanied me to Portland.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="283" data-total-count="16287">The license meant everything to me — it would let me drive, fly and work. But my grandparents worried about the Portland trip and the Washington internship.

I was 22, I told them, responsible for my own actions. But this was different from Lolo’s driving a confused teenager to Kinko’s. I knew what I was doing now, and I knew it wasn’t right. But what was I supposed to do?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="405" data-total-count="16956">I was paying state and federal <classifier class="Topic" idsrc="nyt-classifier" type="Topic" value="yourmoney:::More articles about taxes.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/planning/taxes/index.html"><alt-code value="Taxation" idsrc="nyt-classifier"></alt-code>taxes</classifier>, but I was using an invalid Social Security card and writing false information on my employment forms. But that seemed better than depending on my grandparents or on Pat, Rich and Jim — or returning to a country I barely remembered. I convinced myself all would be O.K. if I lived up to the qualities of a “citizen”: hard work, self-reliance, love of my country.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="502" data-total-count="17458">At the D.M.V. in Portland, I arrived with my photocopied Social Security card, my college I.D., a pay stub from The San Francisco Chronicle and my proof of state residence — the letters to the Portland address that my support network had sent. It worked. My license, issued in 2003, was set to expire eight years later, on my 30th birthday, on Feb. 3, 2011. I had eight years to succeed professionally, and to hope that some sort of immigration reform would pass in the meantime and allow me to stay.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="41" data-total-count="17499">It seemed like all the time in the world.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="2" data-total-count="17501"> </p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="485" data-total-count="17986"><strong>My summer in</strong> Washington was exhilarating. I was intimidated to be in a major newsroom but was assigned a mentor — Peter Perl, a veteran magazine writer — to help me navigate it. A few weeks into the internship, he printed out one of my articles, about a guy who recovered a long-lost wallet, circled the first two paragraphs and left it on my desk. “Great eye for details — awesome!” he wrote. Though I didn’t know it then, Peter would become one more member of my network.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="384" data-total-count="18370">At the end of the summer, I returned to The San Francisco Chronicle. My plan was to finish school — I was now a senior — while I worked for The Chronicle as a reporter for the city desk. But when The Post beckoned again, offering me a full-time, two-year paid internship that I could start when I graduated in June 2004, it was too tempting to pass up. I moved back to Washington.</p><figure id="media-100000000875161" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000000875161 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/06/26/magazine/26illegal5/26illegal5-jumbo.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="547" data-total-count="18917">About four months into my job as a reporter for The Post, I began feeling increasingly paranoid, as if I had “illegal immigrant” tattooed on my forehead — and in Washington, of all places, where the debates over immigration seemed never-ending. I was so eager to prove myself that I feared I was annoying some colleagues and editors — and worried that any one of these professional journalists could discover my secret. The anxiety was nearly paralyzing. I decided I had to tell one of the higher-ups about my situation. I turned to Peter.</p><div id="story-ad-6" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

One afternoon in late October, we walked a couple of blocks to Lafayette Square, across from the White House. Over some 20 minutes, sitting on a bench, I told him everything: the Social Security card, the driver’s license, Pat and Rich, my family.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="582" data-total-count="19905">Peter was shocked. “I understand you 100 times better now,” he said. He told me that I had done the right thing by telling him, and that it was now our shared problem. He said he didn’t want to do anything about it just yet. I had just been hired, he said, and I needed to prove myself. “When you’ve done enough,” he said, “we’ll tell Don and Len together.” (Don Graham is the chairman of The <org idsrc="NYSE" value="WPO%%%business,technology:::More information about Washington Post Company:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/washington-post-company/index.html|||dealbook:::More information about Washington Post Company:::http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=WPO"><alt-code value="Washington Post Company" idsrc="NYSE"></alt-code>Washington Post Company</org>; Leonard Downie Jr. was then the paper’s executive editor.)

In part, this was because I wanted to promote the documentary and write a book about online culture — or so I told my friends. But the real reason was, after so many years of trying to be a part of the system, of focusing all my energy on my professional life, I learned that no amount of professional success would solve my problem or ease the sense of loss and displacement I felt. I lied to a friend about why I couldn’t take a weekend trip to <location style="Y" location-code="world:::More news and information about Mexico.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/mexico/index.html|||travel:::Go to the Mexico Travel Guide.:::http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/mexico/overview.html" code-source="nyt-geo"><alt-code value="Mexico" idsrc="nyt-geo"></alt-code>Mexico</location>.

I have been unwilling, for years, to be in a long-term relationship because I never wanted anyone to get too close and ask too many questions. All the while, Lola’s question was stuck in my head: What will happen if people find out?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="366" data-total-count="24515">Early this year, just two weeks before my 30th birthday, I won a small reprieve: I obtained a driver’s license in the state of Washington. The license is valid until 2016. This offered me five more years of acceptable identification — but also five more years of fear, of lying to people I respect and institutions that trusted me, of running away from who I am.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="70" data-total-count="24585">I’m done running.

I’ve reached out to former bosses­ and employers and apologized for misleading them — a mix of humiliation and liberation coming with each disclosure. All the people mentioned in this article gave me permission to use their names. I’ve also talked to family and friends about my situation and am working with legal counsel to review my options. I don’t know what the consequences will be of telling my story.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="241" data-total-count="25356">I do know that I am grateful to my grandparents, my Lolo and Lola, for giving me the chance for a better life.

Early on, I was mad at her for putting me in this position, and then mad at myself for being angry and ungrateful. By the time I got to college, we rarely spoke by phone. It became too painful; after a while it was easier to just send money to help support her and my two half-siblings. My sister, almost 2 years old when I left, is almost 20 now. I’ve never met my 14-year-old brother. I would love to see them.</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">
