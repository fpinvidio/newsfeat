Heinz will create a company with a market value in excess of $75 billion.\nBut JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo will not get a slice of the millions of dollars in fees generated from the deal. Nor were any of the major international banks like Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Barclays or UBS involved with the deal.\nInstead, two independent investment banks served as the sole advisers to Kraft and Heinz.\nCenterview Partners, a small advisory firm, was the lone adviser to Kraft. Lazard, a publicly traded bank with a broader range of services, was the exclusive adviser to Heinz.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/business/dealbook/biggest-banks-absent-from-biggest-deal-of-year.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
