Siatta was an inmate in the Shawnee Correctional Center, a state penitentiary in southern Illinois, serving a six-year sentence for a home invasion in which he had struck another man with a frying pan.

She noticed something unusual: a loop of blue prison-safe dental floss on the ring finger of his left hand. She had not seen this before.\n“What’s that?” she asked.\nThat, he answered, was his hope. “It’s a reminder that when I get out of here we’re going to have a future, and I’m going to marry you, and we’ll have a real life,” he said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/fashion/weddings/sam-siatta-marries-ashley-volk.html"}
