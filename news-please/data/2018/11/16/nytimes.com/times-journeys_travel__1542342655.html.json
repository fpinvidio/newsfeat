Explore the Acropolis, perhaps the most important ancient monument in the Western world, and the stunning Acropolis Museum. After lunch at a taverna, adults will visit the ancient Agora, while Young Explorers can discover the city on an iPad-based interactive game to complete “The Labors of Hercules.”\nLe Lyrial docks in a beautiful gulf on the western coast of Turkey so you can travel to Ephesus. This ancient Greek city came under control of the Roman Empire around 100 B.C., so it reflects the best of Greco-Roman civilization. It was the center of worship of the mother-goddess Cybele, later known as Artemis, whose temple was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It was also where St. Paul lived for several years, and where he wrote the First Letter to the Corinthians. His passionate preaching to the Ephesians led to his being imprisoned and later expelled. Excavations continue and archaeologists are restoring the Terrace Houses, which offer a glimpse of daily Ephesian life. See the facade of the Library of Celsus, the Temple of Hadrian, with interesting reliefs of Medusa, and the Great Amphitheater.\nContinue to the island of Santorini. In the second millennium B.C., volcanic eruptions shrouded Santorini in pumice and ash and collapsed the island into a fractured caldera. This explosion led to Santorini’s wild, multihued beauty while sending its Minoan civilization into irreversible decline. (An earthquake in 1956 demolished a lot of the modern island.) Adults will visit the stunning archaeological site of Akrotiri and the Prehistoric Museum, while Young Explorers board a sailboat to Nea Kameni, the island in the center of Santorini’s caldera, where they can hike to the summit of the volcano to learn about the area’s geology. Families reunite in Fira town for lunch and free time.\nArrive on the island of Crete, once home to the Minoans, Europe’s earliest developed civilization. From quaint Rethymnon, travel to Knossos and its fabled palace — a maze of frescoed corridors and chambers showing life as it was four millenniums ago. It was also home to the legendary Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull exiled to the elaborate labyrinth. Visit the Heraklion Museum, which houses treasures from Knossos. Young Explorers may hike a portion of the rugged and scenic Imbros Gorge on a guided walk through narrow passages lined with caves. The walk ends on the coast, near the 14th-century Venetian castle of Frangokastello, for a swim.\nArrive in Katakalon, your gateway to Olympia, an ancient sanctuary dedicated to Zeus and one of four sites where the Panhellenic games, the precursor to today’s Olympic Games, were held. Tour the sacred area, including the Temple of Hera, the goddess of women, built around 600 B.C., and the Temple of Zeus, the king of the gods. Also visit the Council House, the Treasuries and the stadium. Young Explorers will be invited to compete in mock Olympic Games on the site of the ancient games.\nSpend the day at day at sea, attending talks by your Times experts, participating in Young Explorers activities, and enjoying the amenities of the ship. Watch for marine life and seabirds as Le Lyrial sails between the tip of Italy’s boot and Sicily on the way to the Ionian Sea and Greece.\nLe Lyrial arrives in Salerno, and adults and children will split up for shore excursions. Adults will head to Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum, Roman cities destroyed in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79, but were preserved in ash and mud. No other sites so completely capture the character of life in the early Roman Empire. The Young Explorers will head to a farm in the Sorrentine Hills overlooking the Gulf of Naples, where they will learn about the cultivation of oranges, lemons, olives and grapes, and making of mozzarella according to traditional methods. They will visit Pompeii in the afternoon.\nAfter breakfast, travel to the center of old Rome for a tour of the Colosseum and Forum. With your family, learn about the important milestones of civilization that took place here, establishing Rome as a world power and witnessing its fall. The Colosseum was built in the first century A.D. as an arena for the people of Rome. The Forum, the center of political and religious life, can trace its roots to the founding of the Roman Republic, around 500 B.C. In the afternoon, transfer to the port of Civitavecchia and board Le Lyrial.\nArrive at the airport in Rome, where you will be met and transferred to your hotel. The afternoon is free to rest or to explore this corner of Rome on your own. In the evening, gather with your fellow Times Journeys families for a welcome reception at the hotel, where Professor Kathleen Lynch of the University of Cincinnati, your Young Explorer counselors and your New York Times experts will introduce you to the program ahead.\nJason Weiser is a storyteller. Formally, he’s the writer and host of “Myths and Legends,” a weekly podcast started in 2015 that adapts world folklore and mythology for the modern audience. From Hercules to Baba Yaga, King Arthur to Mulan, Osiris to Anansi, and more, Jason taps into his training in English literature, narrative theory, and literary analysis from Ohio State University to narrate new retellings as closely to the originals as possible.\nSince joining the New York Times in 1990, Roger Cohen has served as a foreign correspondent, foreign editor and columnist. He is the author of several books, including accounts of conflicts in Eastern Europe and a biography of General Norman Schwarzkopf.\nFrom the ruins of ancient Rome, cruise in the luxury of Le Lyrial to Pompeii and Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympics. On Crete and Santorini, discover the Bronze Age civilization of the Minoans; in Ephesus, explore one of the best-preserved Greco-Roman cities in all the Aegean. Visit the Parthenon in Athens, a temple to Athena and an icon of Western civilization. With activities designed just for children or for the whole family, and with exclusive access to talks and receptions with New York Times journalists, put the past in perspective and make family memories for a lifetime.\nTake the family on a cruise to the ancient world of the Mediterranean, from Rome to Athens, to learn about the history, literature, mythology and culture of the cradle of civilization. This 10-day cruise, intended for families with children 8 to 17, is joined by New York Times columnist Roger Cohen and the storyteller Jason Weiser, making it a unique opportunity for grandparents, parents and children to learn together.\nTerms & Conditions\nThese are the terms under which we offer Times Journeys Tours. By registering and paying your deposit for a Tour, you are entering into this Participant Agreement with us. Please read these terms carefully before making a deposit or payment for a Tour. These terms may be supplemented by additional terms and conditions specific to your Tour (“Supplemental Terms”). In the event of a conflict between this agreement and the supplemental terms, the Supplemental Terms will apply.\nTimes Journeys Participant Agreement\nTimes Journeys, a part of The New York Times Company, acts only as the trip sponsor and is not responsible for the acts or omissions of other parties. The trip described on the Times Journeys website (the “Website”) or in your brochure (the “Tour”) is provided by an independent tour operator named on the Website or in your brochure (the “Operator”). Times Journeys and the Operator are collectively referred to as “we or “us”. The terms and conditions of this Participant Agreement apply to your Tour and the program for the Tour (the “Itinerary”).\nPricing and Inclusions: Quoted Tour prices are per person, double occupancy except where indicated. Prices include programming, planning, handling and operational charges and are based on current rates of exchange, tariffs and taxes in effect at the time of publication. We reserve the right to increase Tour prices to cover increased costs, tariffs, taxes and V.A.T. received after prices are published and to reflect fluctuations in foreign exchange markets. We will not give a breakdown in the price of a Tour or its parts. Modification of Tour content size will not affect the published price.\nExclusions: Quoted Tour prices exclude: trip insurance; airfares between points on the Tour; international airfare, including airfare and other transportation to and from the Tour (unless otherwise noted); costs associated with obtaining passports or entry visas; airport departure taxes (unless otherwise noted); excess baggage charges; gratuities to the Tour directors, drivers and guides; meals other than those specified in the Itinerary; sightseeing not included in the Itinerary; and personal expenses such as laundry, communication charges and optional activities (which are subject to availability).\nReservations and Payments: The Tour deposit amount is listed on the Website or in your brochure. The deposit is required in order to confirm your booking. Upon receipt of the deposit, the Operator will send you confirmation of your booking. Your final payment date will be listed on the confirmation. If a Tour is already full, we will accept deposits on a standby basis. If space becomes available, you will have the choice of joining the Tour by paying in full or forfeiting the space in return for a refund of your deposit. Final payment is due ninety (90) days prior to departure unless otherwise indicated on the Website or in the brochure. If your reservation is made within ninety (90) days of departure, the entire cost of the trip must be paid at the time of the request in order to secure confirmation.\nTravel Insurance: We strongly recommend that you purchase trip cancellation and medical insurance. The Operator will provide the insurance applications along with your booking confirmation. Any questions about what travel insurance does or does not cover should be addressed directly to the travel insurance company. If you decline insurance coverage, you will personally assume full responsibility for any financial loss associated with your travel arrangements, and you could lose your travel investment and/or have to pay more money to correct the situation.\nSingle Travelers: Tour prices are based on double occupancy. Single travelers will be expected to pay the single supplement fee.\nCancellation by You: We must receive your cancellation notice in writing by email, fax or overnight courier, and your cancellation date will be the date on which we receive your notice.\nIf we receive your cancellation notice ninety-one (91) days or more from the Tour departure date, we will refund fifty percent (50%) of the deposit amount, and all of the Tour price, to the extent that you have made that payment.\nIf we receive your cancellation notice ninety (90) to sixty-one (61) days prior to the departure date, we will retain twenty percent (20%) of the Tour price based on double occupancy, excluding optional payments.\nIf we receive your cancellation notice sixty (60) to thirty-one (31) days prior to the departure date, we will retain fifty percent (50%) of the Tour price based on double occupancy.\nIf we receive your cancellation notice thirty (30) days or fewer prior to the departure date, we will retain one hundred percent (100%) of the Tour price.\nAny penalty imposed by an airline, including for airline service between points on the Tour (“Internal Air”) or travel to or from the Tour, is your responsibility.\nYour decision not to participate on the Tour due to State Department warnings, fear of travel, illness or any other reason will be deemed a cancellation. If a flight or other delay for any reason prevents you from joining the Tour on the Tour departure date and time, you will be considered a no-show, and we cannot provide a full or partial refund or credit toward a future Tour, but you may join the Tour late if you wish.\nAir Transportation during the Tour: Internal Air is not included in the price of the Tour. Estimated Internal Air costs will be identified separately on the Website or in your brochure. Internal Air costs and availability are subject to change at any time prior to final payment for your Tour and we reserve the right to increase Tour prices accordingly. We will not change your seat assignment request on commercial aircraft without your permission. However, airlines often change seat assignments to satisfy their loyalty members or because of equipment changes (aircraft type). We are not notified of these changes in advance, and often travelers are not made aware of these changes until they arrive at the airport. We cannot be responsible for seat assignment changes made by the airline. Frequent flier programs are private agreements between airlines and passengers, and we cannot be held responsible for mileage discrepancies involving airline loyalty reward programs.\nPassports and Visas: You are solely responsible for complying with passport and visa requirements. For U.S. travelers, international travel requires a passport valid six (6) months beyond your intended return travel date. In many cases, you will also need to have multiple consecutive blank visa pages within your passport (the number varies depending on the destination(s)). Many destinations also require that visas be obtained prior to travel. It is recommended that you check with the U.S. Department of State website for the latest passport and visa requirements.\nCancellation or Substitution by Us: We will make commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Itinerary as it has been published; however, the final Itinerary may vary due to availability and factors beyond our control. We may in our sole discretion substitute services such as hotels or goods of similar quality for any service or good stated in the Itinerary. If a Times Journeys speaker (“Speaker”) cancels, the Operator will make every effort to find a replacement. You will not be refunded in whole or in part when the Operator is unable to find a replacement Speaker.\nWe reserve the right to cancel any Tour because of inadequate enrollment that makes the trip economically infeasible to operate or because of our concerns with respect to the safety, health or welfare of our travelers or staff. If we cancel a Tour, our liability is limited to a full refund of your payments to us and we will not be liable for any other costs, damages or refunds of any kind for any loss, delay, inconvenience, disappointment or expense whatsoever in such circumstances. If a Tour in progress must be interrupted or canceled, our liability shall be strictly limited to refund of the recoverable cost of any unused portion of the Tour.\nOther Taxes and Fees: Some governments charge departure taxes and/or fees. These fees are the responsibility of each passenger traveling to the designated country and are not included in the Tour price unless stated.\nBaggage: We assume no liability for loss or damage to baggage in transit to and from a Tour or while on a Tour. We recommend purchasing a supplemental travel insurance package.\nChildren: Unless otherwise indicated in the Tour description, all Tour passengers must be at least ten (10) years of age. However, some activities contained within an Itinerary may have a different age restriction than the overall minimum age requirement, in which case details will be provided at the time of booking. We reserve the right to marginally exceed the published maximum group size on family Tours to accommodate a family.\nSuppliers Acts or Omissions: The Operator acts only as an independent contractor to supply or arrange for the travel services named in your Itinerary or otherwise to procure services or goods from third parties such as airlines, hotels and other lodging providers, local hosts, guides, bus lines, car rental companies, driving services, restaurants and providers of entertainment (the “Suppliers”). The Operator and Times Journeys assume no responsibility for any personal injury, property damage or other loss, accident, delay, inconvenience or irregularity which may be occasioned by reason of any act or omission of any of the Suppliers.\nConduct During the Tour: You are responsible for respecting the authority and following the directions of the Tour guide and the laws of the countries in your Itinerary during a Tour. We may exclude you from participating in all or any part of the Tour if, in our sole discretion, your condition or behavior renders you unfit for the Tour or unfit for continuation once the Tour has begun. Unfitness may include, without limitation, any behavior that, regardless of its cause, is inappropriate or offensive or interferes with the delivery of Tour services or may constitute a hazard or embarrassment. In such case, our liability shall be strictly limited to refund of the recoverable cost of any unused portion of the Tour. Should you decide for any reason not to participate in certain parts of the Tour or use certain goods included in the Tour, no refunds will be made for those unused parts of the Tour or goods. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any costs, damages, losses or liabilities arising out of (a) the actions or omissions of any minors traveling with you and (b) if you checked the box indicating that you are signing on behalf of yourself and your traveling companions, your companions’ claims that you were not authorized to agree to this Participant Agreement on their behalf.\nLimitation of Liability and Damages: In no event will we be liable for any injury, loss, claim, damage or any special, punitive, exemplary, direct, indirect, incidental or consequential damages of any kind, whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, that arise out of or are in any way connected with the Tour, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.\nTravel Advisories and Warnings: It is your responsibility to become informed about the most current travel advisories and warnings by referring to the U.S. State Department’s travel website at travel.state.gov or by phone at 888 407 4747.\nForce Majeure: We assume no responsibility for any personal injury, property damage or other loss, accident, delay, inconvenience or irregularity which may be occasioned by reason of any matter beyond our exclusive control including but not limited to a delay or cancellation that causes you to miss all or any portion of the Tour, acts of God, acts of government, war, terrorist acts, riots, disaster, weather extremes or strikes. We have no special knowledge regarding the financial condition of the Suppliers, unsafe conditions, health hazards, weather hazards or climate extremes at locations to which you may travel.

We reserve the right to decline to do business with anyone on a nondiscriminatory basis.\nActive Elements, Medical Conditions and Special Assistance: Some of our Tours incorporate active elements such as hiking, climbing or canoeing; you are responsible for familiarizing yourself with the level of activity that will be involved in your Tour. You must disclose in your Participant Information Form (or at such later time when you become aware of such a condition) any existing physical or mental illness, disability, pregnancy or any other condition which may create a health hazard for yourself or others during the Tour or for which you may require medical attention or special accommodation during the Tour. We will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your needs, but you must notify us at the time of booking for a determination of what assistance we can reasonably provide. We regret that we cannot accommodate you if you have special needs for ordinary daily activities, such as walking and dining.
