The shooting prompted protests that roiled the area for weeks. On Nov. 24, the St. Louis County prosecutor announced that a grand jury decided not to indict Mr. Wilson. The announcement set off another wave of protests. In  March, the Justice Department called on Ferguson to overhaul its criminal justice system, declaring that the city had engaged in constitutional violations.</span>

He said that Mr. Brown punched and scratched him repeatedly, leaving swelling on his face and cuts on his neck.<br><br>Mr. Johnson, who was with Mr. Brown, said that Mr. Brown never reached for the gun. He said Officer Wilson tried to choke Mr. Brown, grabbed his arm to pull him into the car and threatened to shoot.<br><br>Officer Wilson has also said that Mr. Brown had been running toward him when he fired the fatal shots. Some witnesses said that Mr. Brown appeared to be surrendering with his hands in the air when he was killed.","ai2html":"","type":"","image":"","photo_caption":"","photo_credit":"","editstatus":"copyedited","slug":"","show":"","text_position":"","image1":"","image2":"","credit1":"","credit2":"","text1":"","text2":"","text3":"","text4":"","text5":"","promo_type":"","promo_text":"","promo_link":"","promo_image1":"","promo_image2":"","promo_image3":""},{"id":"autopsy","question":"What Did the Autopsies Show?","answer":"<a href=\"https://static01.nyt.com/2014/08/18/us/michael-brown-autopsy-shows-he-was-shot-at-least-6-times.html\">A private autopsy</a> requested by the family of Mr. Brown showed that he was shot at least six times: four times in the right arm and twice in the head. The autopsy was performed by Dr. Michael M. Baden, the former chief medical examiner for the City of New York.<br><br>Dr. Baden said that one of the bullets entered the top of Mr. Brown’s skull, suggesting that his head was bent forward when it hit him, and caused a fatal wound. No gunshot residue was found on the body, which would suggest that the rounds were not fired from very close range; however, Dr. Baden did not have access to Mr. Brown’s clothing, which could contain residue.<br><br>Local officials have not yet released their report on the initial autopsy, though a person briefed on the report said that it showed evidence of marijuana in Mr. Brown’s system. A third autopsy conducted by a military doctor as part of an investigation by the Justice Department also found that Mr. Brown was shot six times.","ai2html":"","type":"","image":"autopsycrop","photo_caption":"","photo_credit":"Dr. Michael M.

Confrontations between protesters and law enforcement officers continued even after Gov. Jay Nixon deployed the Missouri National Guard to help quell the unrest. Since then, protests in Ferguson have persisted in smaller numbers. In early October, the Ferguson Police Department handed over responsibility for policing protests to the county police department, which is larger and better equipped.

The report described a city that used its police and courts as moneymaking ventures, a place where officers stopped and handcuffed people without probable cause, hurled racial slurs, used stun guns without provocation, and treated anyone as suspicious merely for questioning police tactics.

Blacks were once a minority in Ferguson, but the city’s demography has shifted in the last decade after white families moved out to surrounding suburbs.
