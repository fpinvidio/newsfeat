Mr. Caramanica is joined by Joe Coscarelli, the pop music reporter for The New York Times, to excavate the skeletons that are animating this back-and-forth, including but not limited to: Lil Wayne’s fashion sense; Kanye West’s web of collaborations; Drake’s longstanding anxiety about accidental paternity; and the drug-dealing mythology of Pusha-T.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/arts/music/popcast-drake-pusha-t.html?module=inline"}
