The team members who do not live in England already are staying in a rented mansion 15 minutes from the team’s training center in Leeds.\nLater in the season, though, the team will have to fly back and forth on multiple occasions.\n“It’s only a five-hour time difference and a six-hour flight,” Perez said. He also said he was not too concerned about squeezing big men into coach seats. “There are no fat guys in rugby league. It’s one of the most cardiovascularly difficult sports in the world.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/sports/rugby/toronto-wolfpack-england-wales-rugby.html"}
