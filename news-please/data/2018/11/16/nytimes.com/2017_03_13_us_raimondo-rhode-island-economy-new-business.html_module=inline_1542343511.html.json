At the same time, private-sector employment has reached its highest ever.\nMs. Raimondo’s critics say her use of tax incentives — about $130 million so far, according to the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation — amounts to corporate welfare for some of the nation’s richest companies. Former Gov. Lincoln Chafee, a Republican turned independent turned Democrat, said last month that these “giveaways” had turned the state into a “candy store.”\nMs. Raimondo has defended her use of the incentives, saying that other states offer them and that to stop would be to unilaterally disarm. She says they are handled in a fiscally responsible way and are only part of her economic strategy, which also includes abolishing the energy sales tax on businesses, putting computers in schools and investing in work force development, including for people who do not have college degrees. She has also proposed allowing residents to attend two years of public college free.\nMoreover, she says, Rhode Island, long eclipsed by the economic powerhouses of Boston and New York, has a lot more to offer than tax incentives. She boasts of its easy access to Boston and New York, as well as to the ocean, while offering a lower cost of living, more affordable real estate and an emerging pool of young talent.\nIndeed, after Boston won the sweepstakes last year for General Electric’s headquarters (Boston and the state of Massachusetts gave G.E. $145 million in incentives), the company acknowledged that Rhode Island had been a strong competitor. Six months later, it announced that it was putting its GE Digital division in Providence.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/us/raimondo-rhode-island-economy-new-business.html?module=inline"}
