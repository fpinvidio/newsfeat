Both were acquitted.\nBut in Brazil, Ms. Rousseff has not yet been impeached, legal scholars say.\n“In Brazil, the term impeachment is used only after a conviction is made in the trial,” said Daniel Vargas, a law professor at Fundação Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/world/americas/impeachment-dilma-rousseff-brazil-clinton.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
