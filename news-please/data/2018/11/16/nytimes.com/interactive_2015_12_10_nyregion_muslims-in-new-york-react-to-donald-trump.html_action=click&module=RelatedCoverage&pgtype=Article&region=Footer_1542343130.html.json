When we first came to America [in 2002], I had a sister and we used to live in Nashville, Tenn. It was a small town. She wore a head scarf. She was the only one in middle school who wore a head scarf. At that point in time, some person makes a remark that, ‘Oh, she’s a cousin of Osama bin Laden.’ The teacher took the matter into her hands and calmed down the situation.\n“Now, if someone does that similar thing to my daughters, and the teachers are not able to – if they are a Trump fan – and there is no one to rectify that wrong behavior, that’s what I’m afraid of.\n“How can you normalize the situation? If the president is like that, he has the support.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/10/nyregion/muslims-in-new-york-react-to-donald-trump.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
