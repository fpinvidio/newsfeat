Gray, who as a professor and mentor for seven decades delivered college-trained women, immigrants and members of racial and ethnic minority groups into the ranks of American organized labor, died on Sept. 20 in Manhattan. She was 94.\nBonnie Beavers, a niece, confirmed her death.\nProfessor Gray joined the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University in 1946, barely a year after it was founded. She started out as a member of the extension faculty, which reached out to employees and would-be union leaders to educate them in collective bargaining, job training and other programs intended to improve workplace conditions.\nOver the next 57 years, she directed the schoolâ€™s first extension office, in Buffalo, and its metropolitan district office in New York City.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/obituaries/lois-gray-dead.html"}
