Previous leaders disliked alternative viewpoints, but small bookstores, regional newspapers, think tanks and, for a while, social media allowed some space for differing views. Now these channels are all but closed.\nFor the past five years, for example, I’ve been conducting a series of question-and-answer sessions with dozens of Chinese intellectuals — not dissidents but people trying to change the system in some way. It’s hardly an exaggeration to say that almost all of these people have been silenced in the public sphere. Few have been arrested, but the government has turned them into non-persons by blocking their access to any sort of media outlet.\nNot all of this started with Mr. Xi. China’s military expansion — its two new aircraft carriers, for example — is backed by decades of patient modernization. The shutting down of social media accounts also began before Mr. Xi took office, as did the creation of “stability-maintenance” bureaus that have aided the crackdown. And then there’s the broader issue of China’s being a wealthier and more powerful country; under any leader, Beijing was going to shake off its reticence.\nBut Mr. Xi has upped the ante. He’s been far more successful than his predecessors in realizing the Communist Party’s vision of ideological uniformity, rendering his administration as more than a straight-line continuation of past leaders. Having a modernized military is one thing, but using it is another; likewise, the severity of the crackdown on dissent — think of the decision to let the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo die in prison in July — reflects a far harsher approach. Before, China had undercurrents of reform; now these are drying up.\nOne key reason for Mr. Xi’s brusque self-confidence is his family history. Mr. Xi’s father was one of the founders of the People’s Republic, and Mr. Xi grew up in the privileged world of China’s red nobility. That gives him unimaginably more social capital than his two predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, both of whom came from relatively pedestrian backgrounds. Mr. Xi is able to influence the scores of other members of the “hongerdai,” or “red second generation,” who pull many of the strings behind the scenes.\nThese informal networks come on top of Mr. Xi’s formal positions, the most important of which is general secretary of the Communist Party, a title he will get for another five years at the party congress.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/sunday-review/xi-jinping-china.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
