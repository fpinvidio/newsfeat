The trial in the Senate, which will be overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, is expected to take place this month.\n“It marks the final phase,” said Ivar Hartmann, a law professor at Fundação Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro.\nAlthough only a simple majority was needed in Wednesday’s vote, the number of senators who went against Ms. Rousseff exceeded the two-thirds needed to oust her permanently when a final vote is held after the trial, a sign that she faces long odds of surviving.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/world/americas/dilma-rousseff-brazil-senate-impeachment.html"}
