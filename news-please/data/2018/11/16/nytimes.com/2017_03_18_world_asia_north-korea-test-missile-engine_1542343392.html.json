Tillerson is in the region discussing tougher strategies to help end the North’s nuclear and missile programs.\nThe Korean Central News Agency said the test took place at the same northwest facility where the country has been launching rockets to put satellites into orbit, which Western officials have said were efforts to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile.\nAlthough North Korea has never flight-tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, it has recently demonstrated significant progress in its missile programs with new engines that could potentially deliver a nuclear warhead as far away as the United States.\nMr. Tillerson is in Asia, holding discussions with Japan, South Korea and China. In Seoul, South Korea, on Friday, he said that two decades of international efforts to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program have failed, and he warned that all options should be on the table, including pre-emptive military action.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/world/asia/north-korea-test-missile-engine.html"}
