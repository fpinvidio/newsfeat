She did not cite it specifically on her financial disclosure reports, but listed an unidentified parcel of California real estate owned by her husband. Her 2012 filing indicated the property was transferred to an undisclosed party on Christmas Eve that year, and it does not show up at all in her most recent filing, for 2014. On the public record, Calle Mayor L.L.C. continues to hold the property, but changes to the company’s ownership structure would not need to be disclosed.\nFurther muddying the ownership picture were comments Roger Clinton made in the interview. Asked about Bill Clinton’s purchase of the house, he said he shared ownership of it “50-50 with Big Brother.”\n“I put 50 percent of the money into it,” Roger Clinton said.\nHe did not elaborate on when he had bought a share or where he had obtained the money to do so. Depending on the circumstances, such a purchase could have been problematic because of his tax debts, according to tax lawyers. When Calle Mayor bought the house in 2009, the Internal Revenue Service had a lien on all of Roger Clinton’s assets because of $57,762 in unpaid taxes, and California had a lien for $57,827, laying claim to “property now owned or later acquired” by him. The liens were lifted in 2010 and 2011.\nDavid Holtz, a former I.R.S. litigator in Los Angeles, said it could be considered tax evasion if someone concealed ownership of property with the intent of not paying a tax debt. On the other hand, he said, if the debtor was in a repayment plan and not trying to be deceptive, or if someone else bought the house and let the debtor live there, “that would be no problem at all.”\n“If I was still working at the I.R.S. and someone came to me with this, it would raise eyebrows and trigger me to dig further to find out what exactly was going on,” Mr. Holtz said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/us/politics/clinton-first-brother-is-wary-chatty-and-still-occasionally-attracting-attention.html?module=inline"}
