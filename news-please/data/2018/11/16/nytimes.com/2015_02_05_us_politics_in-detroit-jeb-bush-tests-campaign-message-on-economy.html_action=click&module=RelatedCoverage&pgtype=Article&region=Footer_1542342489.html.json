He made what was effectively his first public campaign stop not in Iowa or New Hampshire, where the nominating process begins, but in a heavily black city just emerging from bankruptcy, illustrating his desire to run a primary campaign that looks and sounds more like a general election race.\n“I know some in the media think conservatives don’t care about the cities,” Mr. Bush said. “But they are wrong. We believe that every American in every community has the right to pursue happiness.”\nMr. Bush’s older brother, former President George W. Bush, used similar themes in 2000, running on a platform of what he called compassionate conservatism throughout the primary season and the general election campaign. The question now is whether the Republicans are, as they were 15 years ago, so determined to win the presidency that they will tolerate deviations from orthodoxy.\nBut the younger Mr. Bush may find it difficult to reprise the message of inclusivity. In the hours before he spoke here, a liberal group, American Bridge, released to CNN comments Mr. Bush made in 2013 suggesting that Detroit “repopulate” itself with Hispanics to become “one of the great American cities again.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/us/politics/in-detroit-jeb-bush-tests-campaign-message-on-economy.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
