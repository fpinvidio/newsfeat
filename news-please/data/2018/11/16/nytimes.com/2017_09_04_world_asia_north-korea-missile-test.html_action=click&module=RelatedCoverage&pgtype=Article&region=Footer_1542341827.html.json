It is unclear where the test might be aimed, but Pentagon officials said they were examining options in case it was meant to demonstrate that the North could put a missile, with accuracy, off the coast of Guam, an American territory.\nThe call for the fuel cutoff, which is expected to be part of a draft resolution that the United States is beginning to discuss privately with other members of the Security Council, came a day after North Korea’s most powerful nuclear test in the 11 years it has been detonating nuclear weapons.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/04/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
