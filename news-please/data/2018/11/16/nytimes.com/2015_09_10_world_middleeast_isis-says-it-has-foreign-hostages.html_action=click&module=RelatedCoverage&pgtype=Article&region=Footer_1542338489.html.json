The group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, posted pictures of the two men wearing yellow prison outfits in the latest issue of its online magazine. It identified the Norwegian as Ole Johan Grimsgaard-Ofstad, 48, from Oslo, and the Chinese man as Fan Jinghui, 50, a freelance consultant from Beijing. Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway confirmed Wednesday in Oslo that one of the hostages was a Norwegian man in his 40s being held in Syria and said he had been captured in late January. Chinese officials could not immediately be reached for comment.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/world/middleeast/isis-says-it-has-foreign-hostages.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
