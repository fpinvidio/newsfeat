The nun, Sister Dorothy Stang, was known throughout the region for her work with the poor and landless and for her efforts to preserve the rain forest. The government action comes as disputes about land use and ownership in the world's largest tropical forest are intensifying as the result of new regulations meant to limit deforestation and land speculation. News of the deployment coincided with the killing of another environmental activist on a list of 140 people whose lives have been threatened by logging, ranching and mining interests in the region.
