Iran has been joined by India, Indonesia and Pakistan in suggesting that the Saudis have not fully acknowledged the human toll.\nSaudi officials blamed some pilgrims for failing to follow directions, leading to overcrowding exacerbated by the dehydration of many pilgrims in the heat.\nBut other governments and people in the area at the time have accused the authorities of failing to control the crowds and temporarily closing exits, leaving the pilgrims confined.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/world/middleeast/iranians-killed-hajj-stampede-mecca.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
