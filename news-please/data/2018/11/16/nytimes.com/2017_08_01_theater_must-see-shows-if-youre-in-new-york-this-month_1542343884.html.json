Best known for his Tony-winning adaptation of Mark Haddon’s “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,” Mr. Stephens has also written a series of quieter, diamond-faceted dramas in which static existences are shaken and stirred into new forms, including the smashing two-character “Heisenberg,” seen on Broadway last season with Mary-Louise Parker and Denis Arndt. Now the Atlantic Theater Company, which gave us a fine production of Mr. Stephens’s “Harper Regan” in 2012, presents the New York premiere of his “On the Shore of the Wide World,” a delicately drawn map of roads not taken by three generations of a family in Mr. Stephens’s native Stockport, England.\natlantictheater.org", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/theater/must-see-shows-if-youre-in-new-york-this-month.html"}
