It was a video of the New York City Ballet dancers Heather Watts and Mel Tomlinson, in Balanchine’s radical 1957 ballet “Agon,” the dancers clad in minimal leotards and tights, performing spiky, extraordinary movements to Stravinsky’s astringent score. Mr. Ramasar, an outgoing, talkative boy from the Bronx, knew right away what he thought. “That’s the ballet I want to dance, and that’s the company I’m going to get into,” he said.\nMr. Ramasar, 33, danced that role in “Agon” twice this season, a part he has performed since 2011. He has been a principal at City Ballet since 2009, dancing a remarkably wide range of roles, and has long been a favorite for the creation of new ballets. But it is relatively recently that Mr. Ramasar has entirely come into his own, showing a new technical refinement and polish that have embellished the dynamism and muscular attack of his dancing.\nReviewing Justin Peck’s new “Rodeo” in The New York Times in February, Alastair Macaulay wrote, “Mr. Ramasar, who in the last two years has become an endearing and central artist at City Ballet, seems to carry whole sections on the tide of his immense good humor and large-scaled prowess.”\nThe path from the Bronx to Lincoln Center was not an obvious one. Mr. Ramasar’s father, a former Marine who worked as a computer technician, is of Trinidadian-Indian ancestry; his mother, who was a nurse, is from Puerto Rico. “No one knew anything about ballet in my family,” Mr. Ramasar said in an interview backstage at the David H. Koch Theater, where City Ballet performs. “My father didn’t prevent me from doing it, but he didn’t make it easy.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/arts/dance/amar-ramasars-unlikely-path-to-becoming-a-prince-for-city-ballet.html?module=inline"}
