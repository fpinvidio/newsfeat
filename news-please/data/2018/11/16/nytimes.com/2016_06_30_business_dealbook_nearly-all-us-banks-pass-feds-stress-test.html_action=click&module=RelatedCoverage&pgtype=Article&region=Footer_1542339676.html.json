Last week, the Fed said that all the big banks would be able to make it through a recession and still maintain adequate financial buffers.\nOn Wednesday, a Fed official said that even with the concerns raised, the stress test results suggest that banks would be able to withstand an event like Britain’s exit from the European Union, which has rocked bank stocks over the last week.\nSince the financial crisis, banks have been required to create large capital barriers to cushion against losses from a recession or market shock. While the financial system has not encountered any problems close to the mortgage losses of 2008, banks have been able to withstand more recent challenges like the steep drop in oil prices and the turmoil in Europe.\nWhile tougher capital requirements may be helping to stabilize the banks, they are hampering profitability. The stock prices of many large banks have languished as investors question whether these companies can increase their profits substantially in such a stringent new regulatory environment.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/business/dealbook/nearly-all-us-banks-pass-feds-stress-test.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
