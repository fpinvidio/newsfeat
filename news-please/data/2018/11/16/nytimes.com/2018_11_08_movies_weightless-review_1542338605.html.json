Here, deeply damaged people are prone to exasperating decisions. Yet these characters are so strikingly realized that you can’t help but care for them. It’s a potent mixture of feelings, to be frustrated by someone’s actions and, at the same time, hope that he stays safe.\nWhile working at a landfill in rural New York, Joel (Alessandro Nivola) receives a phone call saying that Will (Eli Haley), his 10-year-old son who he has never seen, has been abandoned by Joel’s former wife. Joel, who is struggling with mental illness, takes in Will, who has health problems of his own. Soon there are serious questions about Joel’s competence and Will’s well-being.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/movies/weightless-review.html"}
