His plainspoken style was sometimes blunt, and searingly honest about himself. The effect was both folksy and sophisticated, a voice from a shrewd and well-informed skeptic.\nHere’s a selection of his writing and public statements:\n‘Crickets Chirping in Newsrooms’\nMr. Carr wrote in 2010 about transparency in journalism in one of his Media Equation columns:\n“If you dumped every reporter who ever sent a snide message or talked smack in private, there would be nothing but crickets chirping in newsrooms all over America.”\n‘The Trick of Enjoying New York’\nIn “The Night of the Gun,” a memoir, Mr. Carr took to the painful task of reporting on his own life. In a 2008 Times review, it was a called a “brave, heartfelt, often funny, often frustrating book.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/business/media/david-carr-excerpts.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
