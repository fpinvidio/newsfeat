That generally meant minimalist lines, light-colored woods and white surfaces: “I just want to keep things pared away as much as possible.”\nFor their own home, he and Ms. Freeman wanted a similar aesthetic. And they knew just the architects for the job: Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, a firm that has designed many Blue Bottle cafes and is currently working on numerous new ones.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/realestate/a-blue-bottle-coffee-house.html"}
