He said such extremists posed “the biggest threat to Islam” today, one that “has never happened before in history,” and called on “all Islamic sects” to confront them, “work to isolate them, surround them and end it.”\nSome social media users reacted with surprise in the West, where Hezbollah, the Shiite militant group that is also Lebanon’s strongest political party, is known for taking Americans captive in the 1980s, and for its alliance with Iran, whose leader in 1989 called for the death of Salman Rushdie over his novel “The Satanic Verses.” But the statement fit with Mr. Nasrallah’s remarks in recent years. He has spoken more and more of the threat from Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, calling them a danger not only to Shiites but also to people of all religions across Lebanon, the region and the world.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/10/world/middleeast/extremists-harming-islam-leader-of-hezbollah-says-.html?module=inline"}
