He will now be the face of a new franchise when the 2017-18 season begins in October.\nA three-time Stanley Cup winner with the Penguins, Fleury will be the centerpiece of a team that will not have much time to find continuity before its first game on Oct. 6 at the Dallas Stars. The Golden Knights will then play their home opener on Oct. 10 against the Arizona Coyotes.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/sports/hockey/vegas-golden-knights-expansion-draft-fleury.html?module=inline"}
