A collection of stock archetypes (careerist dad and cutesy daughter, newlyweds with a bun in the oven, adolescent lovers) must rely on cooperation, resourcefulness, and dumb luck to survive after the undead storm their train cabins. This increasingly hidebound genre gets an infusion of new blood via its strictly contained setting, forcing the director, Yeon Sang-ho, to get creative. If the premise makes it seem like “‘Snowpiercer’ with zombies,” well that’s not a bad thing.\nSkip ... if a snapped femur or spurting artery turns your stomach. This is a zombie movie and Yeon did not come to play around. His bloodbaths are about as subtle as a baseball bat to the face, and not just because of all the non-metaphorical baseball bats to the face.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/watching/recommendations/train-to-busan?auto=true"}
