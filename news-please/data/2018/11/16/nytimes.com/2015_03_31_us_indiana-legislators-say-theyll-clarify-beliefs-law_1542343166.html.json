Mike Pence in saying that they planned to amend a new religious freedom law to make clear that it did not allow discrimination against gays and lesbians, while still insisting that the law did not do so in its current form.\nThe law, approved by the Republican-dominated General Assembly and signed Thursday by Governor Pence, also a Republican, set off a firestorm, with both critics and some supporters saying it would allow businesses to deny service to lesbian and gay consumers based on their religious beliefs. The consequences for Indiana promised to be economic as well as political, with businesses vowing to shun the state.\n“It is not the intent of the law to discriminate against anyone, and it will not be allowed to discriminate against anyone,” David C. Long, president pro tem of the state Senate, said Monday at a news conference with Brian C. Bosma, speaker of the state House of Representatives.\n“We hope to have a fix very soon,” Mr. Long said, adding that lawmakers hoped to “calm the seas here.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/us/indiana-legislators-say-theyll-clarify-beliefs-law.html"}
