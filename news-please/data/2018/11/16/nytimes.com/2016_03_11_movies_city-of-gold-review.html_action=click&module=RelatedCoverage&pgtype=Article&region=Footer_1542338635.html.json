Creative inspiration can be found in a great variety of human pursuits, and criticism is the name we give to the act of identifying and sharing it. A painting is, in that respect, like a poem. A well-written book is like a well-built shelf. A newspaper column is like a documentary film.\n“City of Gold,” directed by Laura Gabbert, is an affectionate portrait of Mr. Gold, a genial walrus of a man with a graying ginger mane and a gentle, gaptoothed smile. The film accompanies him in his green pickup truck as he patrols the streets of Los Angeles, pointing out the best places to find fiery Southern Thai stews and sublime Oaxacan moles. We sit in on editorial meetings and peek over his shoulder as he writes on his laptop at the dining room table. Colleagues and expert witnesses are summoned to pay tribute to his genius and annotate his quirks. We spend some time with Laurie Ochoa, his wife and erstwhile editor, and their two children. We learn about Mr. Gold’s childhood, his early career, his Pulitzer Prize. Ms. Gabbert, in other words, follows the usual documentary recipe.\nBut “City of Gold” transcends its modest methods, largely because it connects Mr. Gold’s appealing personality with a passionate argument about the civic culture of Los Angeles and the place of food within it. His enthusiasm and generosity of spirit stand in definitive rebuke to the myth that critics are crabbed, hostile, pleasure-hating creatures. Rejecting the restaurant reviewer’s customary anonymity, Mr. Gold is warmly received by cooks, servers and restaurateurs, many of whom are grateful for his positive reviews.\nThis is more than boosterism. Mr. Gold, whose first love was music — he studied classical cello and fell in love with punk rock — blends his search for culinary excellence with advocacy and ethnography, and writes in the service of a humane, multicultural vision of urban life. While he eats in and writes about high-end restaurants and ambitious, would-be celebrity chefs, his heart is in the vernacular gastronomy of immigrant and working-class neighborhoods. He is a Walt Whitman of taco trucks, hot-dog stands and pho parlors, of unassuming storefront and strip-mall joints that bring the flavors of the world to Southern California.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/11/movies/city-of-gold-review.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
