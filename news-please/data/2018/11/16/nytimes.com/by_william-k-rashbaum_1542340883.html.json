Rashbaum is a senior writer on the Metro staff of The New York Times, where he focuses on political and municipal corruption, the courts, terrorism and broader law enforcement topics. Previously, he covered federal court in Brooklyn and served as the newspaper’s police bureau chief. He joined The Times in 1999, and has spent three decades writing about crime in New York, the city’s police department and the mob.\r\nMr. Rashbaum was a member of a team of Times reporters that won the Pulitzer Prize in 2009 for its reporting on the involvement of New York’s governor, Eliot Spitzer, with prostitutes. Mr. Rashbaum and several other reporters also wrote a series of stories about the role of Mr. Spitzer’s successor, Gov. David Paterson, in protecting an aide who had abused his girlfriend. The allegations led Mr. Paterson to abandon his gubernatorial campaign in 2010.\r\nIn 2014, he and two colleagues wrote a series of stories about a state anti-corruption commission created by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who abruptly shut it down nine months later. The stories showed that the governor and his aides had interfered with the panel’s work when it focused on people or groups that were close to him. Mr. Cuomo’s shutdown of the panel, known as the Moreland Commission, led to several federal investigations, including one focused on his role in halting its work.\r\nA reporter since 1983, Mr. Rashbaum has worked at the Hearst Newspapers, UPI, Reuters and New York Newsday, leading that newspaper’s police bureau until 1995.  Just before joining The Times, he spent four years at the New York Daily News covering crime and writing longer-term investigative stories.", "filename": "by_william-k-rashbaum_1542340883.html", "image_url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/author-william-k-rashbaum/author-william-k-rashbaum-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "language": "en", "localpath": "/Users/federicoperezinvidio/Projects/illinois/newsfeat/news-please//data/2018/11/16/nytimes.com/by_william-k-rashbaum_1542340883.html", "title": "William K.
