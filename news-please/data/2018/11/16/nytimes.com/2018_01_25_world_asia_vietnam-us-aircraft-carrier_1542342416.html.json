The Defense Ministry of Vietnam announced the port call while the American defense secretary, Jim Mattis, was in Hanoi.\nDanang was where the first conventional American combat unit was deployed in the Vietnam War, landing on a beach there in 1965. Hundreds of thousands more troops were to follow.\nThe arrival of the aircraft carrier, planned for March, would represent the largest presence of United States forces in Vietnam since the war ended in 1975. Smaller Navy ships have visited Vietnam as the two countries’ relationship has improved.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/world/asia/vietnam-us-aircraft-carrier.html"}
