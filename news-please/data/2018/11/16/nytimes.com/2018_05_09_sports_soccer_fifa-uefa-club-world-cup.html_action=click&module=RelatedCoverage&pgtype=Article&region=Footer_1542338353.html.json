The investors would have the right to walk away at the end of each period if returns failed to match expectations.\nOn the other hand, the consortium, in which FIFA would hold a 51 percent stake, would have the right to renew its agreements in perpetuity at a rate of 120 percent of the previous agreements should the tournaments prove to be successful.\nIn the current proposal, the investors would guarantee FIFA $3 billion for each quadrennial Club World Cup. It will pay $2 billion for each edition of the biennial world league, with the exception of the first competition, which will produce a payment of only $1 billion.\nIn his letter sent to Infantino on behalf of UEFA, and copied to other European soccer officials, Ceferin raised several concerns about the concept, including the continued secrecy about the identities of those backing the fund. He also questioned the impact of the changes on soccer’s increasingly busy global calendar and the economics behind the offer. Significantly, Ceferin’s letter also warned FIFA against losing control of the sport to a commercial entity.\nWhen Infantino first revealed the proposal at a FIFA board meeting in March, he said the deal had to be concluded in 60 days. But members refused to give him their backing, citing the mysterious nature of the offer and other concerns. The opposition has grown in the months since.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/sports/soccer/fifa-uefa-club-world-cup.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
