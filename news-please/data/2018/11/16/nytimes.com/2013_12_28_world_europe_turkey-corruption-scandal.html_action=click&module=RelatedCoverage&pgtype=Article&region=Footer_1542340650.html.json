The High Administrative Court said it would suspend the rule while allowing more deliberations on the issue, a week after Turkey’s bar association petitioned the court for its cancellation, according to The A.P.\nSeparately, three members of Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, known by its Turkish initials A.K.P., resigned from the party, bring the total to six in the past week and indicating more dissension in its ranks.\nThe military said in a statement on its website that it would not get involved in a political dispute, a declaration that seemed to be an affirmation of Mr. Erdogan’s success over the years in banishing the military from politics. This is just the sort of crisis that would likely have already triggered the intervention of the military in the past, experts said. In a sense, the conflict amounts to a test of Turkey’s ability to move through a massive political crisis without the military standing by as a guarantor of stability.\nThe prosecutor’s removal from the case came a day after the resignations of three ministers whose sons had been implicated. One of them, the environment and urban planning minister, Erdogan Bayraktar, broke precedent by calling for the prime minister to resign, too.\nSoon afterward, Mr. Erdogan announced a broader overhaul of his cabinet. Though some of the moves had already been planned, so that certain ministers could run in mayoral elections in March, the shake-up was widely seen as an effort to install loyalists around him.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/world/europe/turkey-corruption-scandal.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
