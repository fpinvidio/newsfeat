In this case, they recommended that the United States impose a tariff starting at 50 percent on all washers imported after the first 1.2 million units for the next three years, with the tariff rate to decrease slightly in the next few years. Two of the four commissioners issuing the decision also recommended an additional charge.\nThe trade body will submit its recommendations on Dec. 5 to Mr. Trump, who will have to make a final decision by February. A decision to impose tariffs could further exacerbate trade tensions with South Korea, which is home to Samsung and LG. While South Korea has typically been a strong economic and strategic partner of the United States, particularly in dealing with North Korea, Mr. Trump has taken a more antagonistic approach to a foreign ally.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/us/politics/tariffs-washing-machines-trump.html?module=inline"}
