He did not mention that he was sick with cancer, and I had no way of knowing. On Oct. 4, Mr. Thompson, 50, announced his illness. Five days later, he was dead.\nOur interview was supposed to last 15 or 20 minutes. But Mr. Thompson kept going off on tangents. In retrospect, I am glad I did not try to stop him.\nSome of what he told me would be familiar to anyone who had listened to his campaign speeches: how he was shaped by growing up in public housing and by his mother, a police officer who raised him by herself.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/us/politics/ken-thompson-brooklyn-district-attorney.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
