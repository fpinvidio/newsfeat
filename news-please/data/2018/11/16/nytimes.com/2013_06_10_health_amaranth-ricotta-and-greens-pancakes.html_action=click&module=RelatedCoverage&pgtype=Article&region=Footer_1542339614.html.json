These can be challenging, and I had a few starts and stops along the way until I came up with a collection of recipes I was pleased with, including some delicious, moist savory pancakes made with beet greens and cooked amaranth. I continued working with chia seeds; this time I didn’t soak them, and added them to whole-grain muffins and pancakes. That’s how I used to use chia seeds way back when, before they disappeared for a few decades from the whole-foods scene. You can raise the nutritional content of your whole-grain pastries and breads just by adding 3 or 4 tablespoons; along with their considerable nutrients, the seeds contribute interesting texture like that of poppy seeds.\nYou might have only begun to see teff in the bins of whole-foods stores. These teensy little grains have a lot going for them nutritionally. Teff is higher in calcium than any other grain, and is also high in vitamin C. It contains no gluten. The grain has always been a staple in Ethiopia, where teff flour used to make a spongy flatbread called injera, whose nutritional benefits are a function of both the bacilli in the fermented batter it’s made with and the nutrients in the grain itself. I tried several different recipes for injera this week, but could not succeed in making something I liked. I did, however, make some good buttermilk pancakes using teff flour.\nMillet isn’t quite as tiny as teff or amaranth, but it is quite small, like quinoa. It’s a good source of manganese, phosphorus, magnesium and tryptophan, as well as B vitamins, calcium, potassium and zinc. It’s gluten-free, and I like to use the flour I make by grinding millet in a spice mill to enrich whole-grain breads and pastries.\nAmaranth, Ricotta and Greens Pancakes\nThese are inspired by the rice, beet greens and ricotta blinis I made a few weeks ago for Recipes for Health. Made with amaranth, a high-protein, gluten-free grain, the cakes have a lighter texture than the rice cakes. Cooked amaranth is good in baked goods and griddled cakes because it’s so moist. I cooked the amaranth in homemade turkey stock (made and frozen after Thanksgiving), and the stock gave it a very nice flavor; I recommend cooking it in some kind of flavorful stock, whether it’s vegetable, chicken or turkey.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/health/amaranth-ricotta-and-greens-pancakes.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
