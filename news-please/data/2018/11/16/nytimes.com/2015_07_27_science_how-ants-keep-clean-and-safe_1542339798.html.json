Dirty antennas don’t pick up scents, and that’s how ants, in particular, navigate and communicate.\nWorking with his adviser, Walter Federle, and other colleagues at Cambridge and the medical school at the University of Warwick, Dr. Hackmann used electron microscopes, video recordings and other experiments to study the cleaning mechanism that is found at a joint in each front leg of the carpenter ant Camponotus rufifemur.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/science/how-ants-keep-clean-and-safe.html"}
