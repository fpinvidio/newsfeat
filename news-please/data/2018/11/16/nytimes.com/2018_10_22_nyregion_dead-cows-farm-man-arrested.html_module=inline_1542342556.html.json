Mr. Mumbulo had hoped to start producing milk again.\nSomething went horribly wrong.\nOn Sunday, Mr. Mumbulo, 45, was arrested by New York State Police after they discovered 27 dead cows and several inches of manure inside the barn he was renting. Mr. Mumbulo was charged with 27 counts of overdriving, torturing and injuring animals under the state’s agriculture and markets law.\nThe grisly discovery of the cows comes at a time when many New York dairy farmers are struggling economically because of low milk prices and difficult weather conditions.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/nyregion/dead-cows-farm-man-arrested.html?module=inline"}
