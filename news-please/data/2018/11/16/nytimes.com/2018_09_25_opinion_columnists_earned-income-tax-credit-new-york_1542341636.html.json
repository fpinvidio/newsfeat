The American economy has almost tripled in size since 1980, yet the average inflation-adjusted wage for low-income workers has risen only about 10 percent.\nThe most effective policy for fighting this trend — and making sure working people aren’t mired in poverty — has been the Earned Income Tax Credit.

It avoids the problematic incentives of welfare because it encourages people to work.\nThe E.I.T.C. hasn’t come close to making up for soaring pretax inequality, but it has made a meaningful difference.
