He said there had been “repeated incidents” over the last year in which the Russian military planes have come close to other air and sea traffic in “provocative” actions.\n“We continue to be concerned about this behavior,” Mr. Earnest said. The episodes, he added, are “a source of some irritation.”\nHe declined to say whether or how the administration planned to raise the issue with Russia.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/world/europe/russian-plane-us-ship-baltic-sea.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
