I don’t remember the first time well. But I remember the second, in 1918, very well — that terrifying day, the dead children … until we managed to get to Leninakan. We lost our relatives — my aunt, her three sons. They tortured my uncle in a Turkish prison, then killed him. There were suffering Armenians everywhere.\n“I was the daughter of a rich household. But they did everything during the massacres — murders, rape, everything — nobody was spared.”\nThis and the following captions contain excerpts of what survivors told Ms. Armenakyan. In some of the photos, survivors hold up portraits of themselves when they were younger.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2016/04/21/blogs/survivors-of-the-armenian-genocide.html"}
