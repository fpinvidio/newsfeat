          <p>If Josiah Wells had reached the podium Tuesday, he would have been the first athlete from New Zealand to win a medal at the Winter Games in 22 years and only the second ever.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>At the foot of the halfpipe, drenched after skiing through big, wet snowflakes, he looked at a group of New Zealand fans waving the flag of his country. He smiled.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>“I’m that guy,” he said to them. “I’m the guy who got fourth.”</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>Then he let out a King Kong-style yell.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>The gold, silver and bronze medals went to skiers from the United States, Canada and France.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>“New Zealand has only had one medal in 100-year Winter Olympic history,” Wells said. “So it would have been really cool to get one of them. But tonight it didn’t work out.”</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>Wells said he felt good about his skiing, but once he saw the work of his competitors on the halfpipe, he realized that the podium was no longer within reach. Wells, who is coached by his father, Bruce, hails from a skiing dynasty. His brothers, Byron, Beau-James and Jackson have competed as professional freeskiers. </p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>Wells will be 27 by the time of the Pyeongchang Games in 2018. He is not sure if he will compete there.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>“I’m going to ski until my body doesn’t let me anymore,” he said. “So hopefully I can be here representing New Zealand again.”</p>

          <p>Soon after the 57 skiers started the 30-kilometer mass-start cross-country race, the race for fourth was on. Three women from Norway quickly pushed to the front, and they were unlikely to give up a spot on the podium.</p>


          <p>So there was Kerttu Niskanen of Finland, coming to terms quite early with the notion that fourth place just might have to do.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>The 30K mass start is a punishing event, one that was not made easier by the unseasonably warm weather on the slopes of the Psekhako Ridge. </p>


          <p>“Fourth place is good,” Niskanen said later. “The Norwegian girls were really good today.”  </p>


          <p>The three Norwegian leaders were comfortable in front, creating nearly a minute of separation between third and fourth place. </p>


          <p>A critical moment for Niskanen was when she decided to change skis during the race, something the Norwegian athletes did not do. Niskanen estimated that took 30 seconds and therefore had not kept her from finishing third. Perhaps it helped her hang on to fourth. </p>


          <p>“I felt quite good,” Niskanen said.</p>

          <p>China’s men’s curling team won bronze at the last Winter Games, in Vancouver, the first time a team from Asia finished on the podium. This time, the Chinese curlers were left on the verge of tears as they slid off the ice for the last time.  They had lost to Sweden.</p>


          <p>Even in the “gentleman’s sport” of curling, where players call their own foul shots and buy the losers beers after competing, fourth place is not easy.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>“We’re disappointed at this loss, but we have tried our best,” said Liu Rui, the skip of China’s team.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>China, ranked seventh in the world, is relatively new to this sport, and its curlers have gained the respect of the old guard for their  technical prowess, which was why the two hog-line violations, including one from Liu, made the outcome particularly hard.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>“The reason that we lost is because of the last end,” Liu, who lives in Harbin, said. “We made a mistake.”</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>Liu finished the Olympics with an overall accuracy rate of 87 percent. He maintained a positive front.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>“Our team has played very well in this Olympics,” Liu said. “And I’m very satisfied with my team.”</p>

          <p>In the sport of aerials, which is kind of like ski jumping crossed with high diving, a landing that features a faceplant somersault is not recommended.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>So when Qi Guangpu of China saw his teammate, Jia Zongyang, flip head over heels, he might have thought he would get his chance at the podium after all.</p>


          <p>Qi fell during his landing, too, but he fell backward and popped right back up, which was not nearly as dramatic as Jia’s tumble.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>But the judges disagreed. Qi, who had been a favorite to win going into the competition, came in fourth.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>The format of the aerials competition made the loss especially cruel. The final round has only four aerialists, which turns the competition into a game of musical chairs with only one loser.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>On Monday night, that was Qi.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>He maintained a stoic pose afterward. “I don’t regret anything,” he said. “I’m feeling very proud. Fourth place is O.K. for me.”</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>Was he resentful of his teammate for beating him with a snowy somersault? </p>


          <p>“I’m very proud of him and very happy that he got third place,” Qi said.</p>

          <p>In any other event but the Olympics, the snowboard cross competitor Faye Gulini of the United States would have been thrilled with a fourth-place finish. Here, she was slightly less than that.</p>


          <p>“A 12th, or something, it’s ‘Eh, I blew it,’ ” Gulini said. “But to be fourth is kind of tough. But I’m happy over all. It’s the Olympics. I’ll take the fourth place.”</p>


          <p>Gulini, in her second Olympic appearance (she was 12th in 2010), has long competed in the shadow of Lindsey Jacobellis, an eight-time Winter X Games champion. At the X Games in January, Jacobellis won and Gulini was sixth.</p>


          <p>Jacobellis, however, has a wicked streak of disappointment at the Olympics. In one semifinal Sunday, Jacobellis fell near the bottom of the course while holding a big lead. Her medal hopes were gone.</p>


          <p>Gulini, meanwhile, kept quietly advancing through the bracket. </p>


          <p>“Where I kind of excel, I’m consistent,” Gulini said. “As you saw, a lot of people fell. And I’m really good at staying on my feet.”</p>


          <p>She fell behind quickly in the final. But then two of her nearest competitors wiped out. Gulini survived but could not catch the three women in front of her, all of whom were ecstatic to win medals.</p>


          <p>“It would have been nice to get on the podium,” she said. But it was nice being where she was, too.</p>

          <p>It is kind of like being an A-minus student at an elite school.</p>


          <p>The speedskater Marrit Leenstra of the Netherlands finished in fourth place behind not one, not two but three of her Dutch teammates in the 1,500 meters.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>Jorien ter Mors won gold and set an Olympic record with a time of 1 minute 53.51 seconds. Ireen Wust was second in 1:54.09, and Lotte van Beek took bronze in 1:54.54. Leenstra was 1.86 seconds behind van Beek.</p>


          <p>“This year, I’ve found myself a lot of times in the fourth place,” she said. “But every time I think I can do better. But I didn’t show it this time.”</p>


          <p>The Netherlands has won 16 medals in speedskating, five of them gold, a startling tally. While her teammates would be celebrating their latest haul, Leenstra’s feelings were tangled.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>She said she did not watch the flower ceremony, but planned to watch the medal ceremony later, “when there’s a little less emotion with it.”</p>


          <p>Two of the women on the podium were competitors of Leenstra’s on the national circuit, and one is a training partner.</p>


          <p>“It’s always nicer that you’re beaten by the other Dutch girls than by other countries,” she said. “So I’m happy for them. And this is the best result we could have.”</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>She added, “For my country it’s really nice, but for me it’s not as nice.”</p>

          <p>Placing fourth in the Olympics can be punishing on the psyche, and sometimes it is merciless on the body, too. During her final jump in the aerial competition, Li Nina of China lost the rhythm of her back flip with two double full twists and bounced off the snow, then spun, slid and bounced some more.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>It was not clear if she would be in any condition to talk afterward, but there she was just a few minutes after the results were posted, still wearing her green helmet and picking apart what had gone wrong.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>“After the first twist, when I was doing the second twist, I felt that the speed was not enough, so I struggled,” she said, through an interpreter.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>What if she had the jump to do over again?</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>“I might add more speed,” she said. “If the speed was better then I probably would have succeeded.”</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>The notion of adding more speed to a jump that looks as perilous as the one that Li attempted is a good example of daredevil logic. </p>


          <p>What would this 31-year-old, four-time Olympian do next?</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>“Something related to skiing,” she said. “I’m retiring.”</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>No, what she would do next, as in the next half hour or so?</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>“Just call my mom and let her know that I’m safe and sound because she watched my performance on TV and so she must be worried,” she said.</p>

          <p>The only thing worse than finishing fourth is doing it again. And again.</p>


          <p>The Canadian luge team came to Sochi looking for its first Olympic medal. It left with three fourth-place finishes, coming on successive nights. Combined, the three bronze medals were less than one second beyond the Canadians’ grasp.</p>


          <p>The final event was the team relay, new to the Winter Games, in which each country’s top man, top woman and top doubles team race in succession, smacking a target at the finish line that tells the next team member to start.</p>


          <p>The Canadians won a silver medal in team relay at last year’s world championships in Whistler, British Columbia. They had reasonable expectations to reach the podium in Sochi.</p>


          <p>First came Alex Gough. Two days earlier, she had finished fourth in singles. She had the fourth-fastest time again.</p>


          <p>Then came Sam Edney. He finished 11th in singles, but he recorded the fifth-best mark among the men this time, keeping the Canadians in contention.</p>


          <p>Finally came the doubles team of Tristan Walker and Justin Snith. They had finished fourth in doubles the day before by five hundredths of a second. When they crossed the finish line in the team event, the scoreboard unblinkingly displayed Canada’s time and its rank.</p>


          <p>Fourth. </p>


          <p>Canada’s combined time for the three runs was 2 minutes 27.395 seconds – one-tenth of a second from a medal.</p>


          <p>“I think I’ve said all there is to say about being fourth,” Gough said, tears filling her eyes. “It sucks. It’s terrible. To come in fourth by a tenth, and to know we had it in our runs, and that each of us didn’t have the performance that we would have liked to, and we could have had it – I mean, I think we all feel like we let each other down.”</p>


          <p>On a video screen behind the Canadians, the teams from Germany, Russia and Latvia stood atop a podium and soaked in the adulation. The cheering nearly drowned out the softly spoken words of the Canadians. Gough walked away. Edney rubbed his face with a hand and looked over his shoulder, back toward the commotion reserved for medalists.</p>

          <p>Except it wasn’t quite true after the women’s downhill. The competition ended with the event’s first two-way tie for gold, a rare result that meant that no one received a silver medal.</p>

          <p>Merighetti, 32, was not expected to win a medal, and she insisted that she saw the fourth-place finish as a victory and a capstone to her Olympic career, which she said would end after Sochi.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>“I tried to do everything,” she said. “I tried to push hard, and I did.” </p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>She knows exactly where the medal slipped out of her grasp: the end of the course, within sight of the crowd cheering in the grandstands.</p>

        <label>On her fourth-place finish

      <div class="g-copy">

          <p>Hannah Teter, who won the Olympic gold medal in the halfpipe in 2006, was leading the field after the first round Wednesday, thanks to her mix of stylish high spins pulled off with panache.</p>


          <p>She was feeling good.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>But Kaitlyn Farrington outdid her. Then Torah Bright pushed Teter to third. She could live with third.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>Then, on the last run of the night, Kelly Clark, a fellow American, delivered an especially impressive run that pushed Teter off the podium by a quarter of a point.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>Teter, a Belmont, Vt., native who is known as one of the more candid winter sports athletes, was not pleased.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>“Fourth is the worst position to finish,” she said. “You just missed the podium.”</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>“It’s definitely a bummer,” she added.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>Teter said the right things about being happy for her friends – two Americans won medals, after all. But she thought she deserved a higher score. (In snowboarder speak, that translates to: “I’m not super-stoked on the judging, obviously.”)</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>Now that the competition is over, Teter, 27, said she was going to go relax in Tahoe, Calif. Maybe work on her maple syrup company.</p>


          <p> </p>


          <p>But mostly, she said, she wanted to start getting ready for the 2018 Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. She doesn’t plan to finish fourth.</p>

          <p>Shaun White wins gold. He did it in Turin in 2006, he did it in Vancouver in 2010, he does it at the X Games every year.</p>


          <p>Shaun White doesn’t finish second. He doesn’t finish third. He <em>definitely</em> doesn’t finish fourth.</p>


          <p>And yet, there he was Tuesday night when the giant scoreboard blinked the judges’ decision in the men’s snowboard halfpipe competition.</p>


          <p>White had made a dramatic entrance, as he usually does, by going last. When he botched his first run, the crowd wondered what virtuoso tricks he would pull out on the next one, because surely he would deliver. It would have to be something special to win gold, but come on, it’s Shaun White.</p>


          <p>Then he botched his second run. Fourth place.</p>


          <p>White soldiered through a few television interviews, seemingly unrattled. He was smiling. But his handlers quickly ushered him out of sight, better to process the results away from the klieg lights.</p>


          <p>When he emerged later in the night, he credited the medal winners and vowed that he would be back – right after he tours with his rock band. That’s a consolation most fourth-place winners go without.</p>


          <p>“It just wasn’t my night, which is really tough to say,” he said. “It’s a big night.”</p>

          <p>Anders Gloersen of Norway was coasting along with the tight lead pack in the men’s cross-country free sprint, feeling good. A medal seemed to be in sight.</p>


          <p>“I was No. 3, and I didn’t feel very tired,” he said. “I was feeling like this is still anybody’s race.”</p>


          <p>But a split-second later, it wasn’t anybody’s race at all, or at least not his. “I was fighting for a  medal, and then suddenly, I’m in the snow,” Gloersen said.</p>


          <p>He had collided with two other skiers – Sergey Ustiugov of Russia and Marcus Hellner of Sweden – in a mishap that may have had something to do with the soft snow and that left all three of them sprawled on the ground.</p>


          <p>Gloersen found himself pushed up against the fence, watching the competition zip past.</p>


          <p>“I got up, and I just started counting people in front of me,” he said.</p>


          <p>His time, 4 minutes 2.05 seconds, was more than half a minute slower than his fastest run in the earlier qualifying heats, and it nudged him off the medals stand and into the unfortunate fourth spot. (The skier who came in third, Emil Jonsson, had a time of 3:58.13, and lay prone with exhaustion on the ground after the race was over). </p>


          <p>“No, I’m not particularly happy,” Gloersen, 27, said after the race. “This is going to be tough to digest for the next couple of days.”</p>


          <p>The winner, his Norwegian teammate Ola Vigen Hattestad, won with a time of 3:38:39, nimbly avoiding the collision behind him. </p>


          <p>“When you fall in the Olympics, there’s not so much chance for a medal,” Gloersen said. </p>

          <p>Four years ago, at the Vancouver Olympics, the German luger Andi Langenhan placed fifth. He was second in the world championships last year, propelling him to Sochi with hopes to win a medal. </p>


          <p>He arrived with the phrase “Bitte folgen” on his luge. It’s German for “Please follow.” The luge field at the Sochi Games followed his instructions — except for three riders. </p>


          <p>Langenhan missed a medal by 558-thousandths of a second. That half-second will haunt him for at least the next four years. </p>


          <p>“The little man in my head always says go on, go on, go harder, for sure,” Langenhan said after the fourth and final race in the men’s singles competition Sunday night. “But I know I can do it. All the other guys who are unknown who come to the top 10 can reach a medal for sure, and everybody is getting older and knows what to do.” </p>


          <p>His countryman Felix Loch repeated as gold medalist. Albert Demchenko, competing in his seventh straight Winter Games for Russia, won silver. Armin Zöggeler of Italy reached the podium for the sixth consecutive Games and claimed bronze. </p>


          <p>“Last year I beat them all, so I know I can do it,” Langenhan said. “But Olympic Games are always special. They’re competitive and hard to win and hard to achieve a medal.” </p>


          <p>“But at least somebody has to be fourth, and that’s me,” he added.</p>

          <p>Two-tenths of a second can mean different things to different athletes. An up-and-comer who lost by such a narrow margin might consider it a symbolic victory and motivation to work harder.</p>


          <p>For Aksel Lund Svindal, two-tenths of a second represented a bitter defeat.</p>


          <p>In the men’s downhill, Svindal, the popular Norwegian who won three Alpine skiing medals at the last Winter Olympics and was the world champion in the downhill last year, was 19-hundredths of a second away from a podium finish.</p>


          <p>“It is pretty much the worst place to be,” Svindal said of finishing fourth. “I’ve been there before and probably will be again.”</p>


          <p>Svindal, Norway’s flag-bearer at the opening ceremony, clearly had his sights on the gold medal, which went to Matthias Mayer of Austria.</p>


          <p>“I made mistakes, and I could have won,” said Svindal, who was 29-hundredths of a second behind Mayer.</p>


          <p>Svindal said he took some solace in the fact that Kjetil Jansrud, his teammate and roommate at the Olympics, finished third.</p>


          <p>“It saves the day for the team, but for me, personally, it doesn’t completely save the day,” Svindal said. “Of course, you want to get a medal.”</p>

          <p>Sven Thorgren, a 19-year-old from Sweden, scored an 87.50 on his final run of the men’s snowboard slopestyle final, a strong, if surprising, total that put him in third place with four riders to go. Thorgren, ranked 20th in the world, was ecstatic to be in the medal conversation so late in the final round.</p>


          <p>Following snowboard protocol, he stood by the medals podium after his run, waiting as the remaining riders tried to beat him. One was a friend, the Norwegian star Stale Sandbech.</p>


          <p>“When Stale landed his run, I was pretty sure he was going to beat me,” said Thorgren, who ended up finishing fourth in Saturday’s event. Sage Kotsenburg of the United States won the gold medal, Sandbech took second, and Mark McMorris of Canada was third.</p>


          <p>Thorgren spoke afterward about taking something positive away from his runs here. He could have come off the first rail a bit better, he said, but “that was the only mistake I did for my run, so it was a pretty hard run for me, and I’m superhappy that I landed it.”</p>


          <p>He hesitated and looked to his right. Sandbech was there, doing his own interviews, smiling broadly and sticking a tiny Norwegian flag behind his ear.</p>

          <p>The short-track speedskater J.R. Celski, 23, made the transition from in-line skating to speedskating when he was 12, and came of age in the long shadow of Apolo Ohno, practicing at the same rink in the Seattle area and competing as his teammate on the international circuit. He later delayed his admission to the University of California, Berkeley, to train with the United States team for the 2010 Vancouver Games.</p>


          <p>When he lined up for the 1,500-meter final Monday at the Iceberg Skating Palace, Celski was the only American on the ice. Ohno retired, clearing the way for Celski to take over the mantle of best American short-track skater. Celski has two world championship gold medals, but none from the Olympics.</p>


          <p>On the final lap, Celski lost his pace. Charles Hamelin of Canada won gold, Han Tianyu of China won silver and Viktor Ahn of Russia won bronze.</p>


          <p>Celski was fourth in 2 minutes 15.624 seconds, 562-thousandths of a second behind the bronze medalist.</p>


          <p>“I was in a good position and I didn’t protect my track well enough,” Celski said.</p>


          <p> He knows what it is like to be on the other side of the third-fourth divide. At the Vancouver Games, he won bronze medals in the 1,500 and 5,000 relay.</p>


          <p> “I come out here to win gold,” he said. “So any position behind that is tough.”</p>
