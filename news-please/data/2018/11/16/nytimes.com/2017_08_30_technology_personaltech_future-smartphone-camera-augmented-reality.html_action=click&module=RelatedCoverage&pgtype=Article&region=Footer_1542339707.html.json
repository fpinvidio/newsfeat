For the last decade, smartphones have gotten thinner and faster and thinner and faster and, well, you get the picture.\nBut it’s too soon to write off our smartphones as boring. The gadgets are still evolving with new technologies. And for a clue as to what the smartphone of the future might look like, turn your attention to the device’s cameras and the software and sensors that make them tick.\nHere’s a peek into how the camera may come into play: As soon as you pick up your gadget, it will see you and know you are the owner and unlock the screen. Overseas, you will be able to point the camera at a restaurant menu to translate items into your native language. When shopping for furniture, you can point your phone camera at your living room floor and place a virtual rendering of a coffee table down to see how it looks and move around and peek underneath it.\nSome of this futurism is already starting to happen.\nNext month, Apple plans to hold a special event to introduce a set of new iPhones, including a premium model that can scan 3-D objects — including your face. Samsung, the No. 1 phone maker, also recently introduced the Galaxy Note 8, highlighting its fast dual-lens camera as the signature feature. And rivals will soon work to catch up with Samsung and Apple.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/technology/personaltech/future-smartphone-camera-augmented-reality.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
