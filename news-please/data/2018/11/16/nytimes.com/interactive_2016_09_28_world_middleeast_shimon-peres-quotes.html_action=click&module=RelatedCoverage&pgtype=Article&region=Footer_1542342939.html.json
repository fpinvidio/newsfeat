Israel will not have a stable thriving economy without peace. Israel will not have a healthy society free from poverty and discrimination without peace. Israel has no chance of preserving its Jewish democratic character without peace. Israel will be giving up its future if it sees the status quo as its desire.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/28/world/middleeast/shimon-peres-quotes.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
