By clicking \"I accept\" or \"X\" on this banner or using our site, you consent to the use of cookies unless you have disabled them.\nDrive to Damour, a small town southeast of Beirut. Pass through the charming town of Deir el-Qamar, which has maintained the architectural prosperities of the 17th and 18th centuries. Continue to the imposing palace of Beiteddine. The palace is the best example of early-19th-century Lebanese architecture, built over a 30-year period by Emir Bashir. Visit the palace complex and its museums showcasing costumes and weapons of that era, as well as a fine collection of well-preserved Byzantine mosaics.\nTravel to Baalbek to visit Lebanon’s greatest Roman treasures, the largest and most noble Roman temples ever built, also among the best preserved. The site includes the temples of Jupiter, Bacchus and Venus, with a remarkable Great Court and the Hexagonal Forecourt. Continue to Château Ksara to visit the historic caves and have lunch and a tasting of the wine produced there. Château Ksara has preserved Lebanon’s rich winemaking heritage for over 150 years. Founded in 1857 by Jesuit priests, who produced the country’s first dry red wine, Château Ksara is Lebanon’s oldest and largest winery. Later meet with local journalists from leading Arabic or English news organizations at their offices in Beirut. Tonight attend a special event and dinner at Music Hall, a live music stage representing a new and unique concept. The venue features short, live musical acts that showcase talents from around the world in a series of staged, eclectic performances employing the best technologies in sound and light equipment. Explore behind the scenes and meet some of the performers.\nSet out with your guide on a full-day tour of Beirut and the surrounding area. One of the oldest cities known, Beirut has had a rough time since 1975 when a civil war broke out, though it has been relatively quiet in recent years. Drive to the downtown district to see the huge reconstruction project taking place. This project has revealed that the capital is situated on the site of an ancient settlement dating back at least 5,000 years. Recent excavations have uncovered important archaeological sites from Canaanite, Phoenician, Persian, Roman, Byzantine, Umayyad, Abbassid, Crusader, Mamluke and Ottoman eras. The reconstruction project includes new buildings constructed in the traditional style. The new constructions stand beside hundreds of old structures that have been restored and renovated to their original shapes, including Beirut’s souks and historical mosques and churches. Proceed to the Corniche and take a short walk along the favorite promenade of many Beirutis. This patch climbs steeply to a cliff edge, with an array of clifftop restaurants and cafes featuring a panoramic view of the bay and the famous Pigeons’ Rock. Descend to a stretch of beautiful sandy beach and the prestigious residential area of Ramlet el-Baida. Visit the National Museum, and continue to one of the major local universities in Lebanon to meet with university students and professors in the political science or journalism fields. After lunch, continue to Byblos, a town that has been continuously inhabited for 7,000 years. Visit its ancient sites, and then explore the old part of the town on foot, starting from the fishermen’s harbor, leading uphill toward the Church of St. John the Baptist and the souks. Return to your hotel and enjoy an evening at leisure.\nAfter breakfast drive to the Dead Sea. Sitting some 1,300 feet below sea level on Jordan’s western border with Israel, the Dead Sea is the lowest point on the planet. Since the days of Cleopatra and Herod the Great, people have flocked to these waters in pursuit of their curative secrets: Because of high annual temperatures, low humidity and high atmospheric pressure, the region’s air is densely oxygenated and deeply refreshing to breathe. Highly rich in natural minerals and salts, the water of the sea itself is renowned for its potent anti-inflammatory properties. Smear on a relaxing mud facial, float in its buoyant waters and enjoy a therapeutic treatment some 2,000 years in the making. Lunch is at the Dead Sea Mövenpick. In the afternoon return to Amman and fly to Beirut and transfer to your hotel for dinner and overnight stay.\nSun City Camp In the heart of Wadi Rum’s majestic desert, this luxurious camp offers a variety of tent styles, many with skylights to allow you to gaze at the stars and the moon. All have private bathrooms and showers.\n“Vast, echoing and God-like” is how T. E. Lawrence described Wadi Rum. It was here, in the largest and most magnificent of Jordan’s desert landscapes, where Lawrence of Arabia lived with his Bedouin friends and allies during World War I. The area takes its name from this, the grandest of the whole network of Jordan’s wadis, or valleys. For the past thousand years, these valleys offered the easiest passage to the Nomadic Bedouin and the trading caravans en route to or from the Arabian Peninsula. Explore Wadi Rum from the back of a camel. Later, pause for a Bedouin lunch in a camp prepared especially for your group. After lunch, take a 4x4 to explore the vast sand dunes and rose-tinted mountains where Bedouin tribes still camp. See the engravings the Bedouin have made on the rocks representing animals, people and events of their world. Continue to Sun City Camp for an evening in the desert.\nToday you have a full day to explore Petra, set in a canyon that has only one entrance, known as the Siq, a narrow passageway that could be easily defended against attack by an invading army. An English poet called Petra “the rose-red city half as old as time,” which is only a slight exaggeration: It was carved out of the mountains between 800 B.C. and A.D. 100 by Nabatean Arabs who came from northern Arabia long before the arrival of either the Greeks or the Romans. In this era Petra served not only as the capital of the Transjordan state but also as a virtually inaccessible fortress. In the first and second century, after the Romans took over, the city reached the peak of its fame. Once a rich merchant city and a stop for the camel caravans bringing spices, silk and slaves from Arabia to the Mediterranean, Petra was lost for 1,000 years, emerging from its veil of antiquity in 1812, when it was rediscovered by the Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Today Petra is Jordan’s leading tourist attraction. Its major sites include the baths, markets, the Treasury (familiar to viewers of the movie “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade”), the Temple of the Winged Lions, the Corinthian Tomb and the Palace Tomb. If you want, and you are in good enough shape, you can take an unguided and strenuous walk to and from the Monastery, accessible only on foot. Have lunch with Mofleh Bdoul, one of the last of the Bdoul tribe remaining inside the center of Petra. Mofleh makes his home in a cave not far from the one in which he was born more than 70 years ago. Learn about Petra from the perspective of a lifelong resident. In the evening, take a cooking class at Petra Kitchen, a locally managed restaurant that offers a hands-on approach to creating regional Levantine cuisine. You can help create a typical Jordanian dinner and get an inside glimpse into the secrets behind the famous dishes. A fun evening of learning ends as you enjoy the fruits of your labor for dinner.\nTravel through countryside rich in biblical history from Amman to Petra, along the scenic King’s Highway that runs south over mountains and through the beautiful Gorge of Amman, known today as Wadi Mujib. Madaba, the “City of Mosaics,” is perched on an archaeological site with more than 4,000 years of history buried beneath it and famed for its spectacular Byzantine and Umayyad mosaics. The quality and quantity of mosaic flooring has made Madaba one of the most prominent cities in the world for this beautiful art form. Hundreds of mosaics from the fifth through the seventh centuries are scattered throughout Madaba’s churches and homes. From the outside St. George’s Church doesn’t look like much. But it houses a mosaic floor depicting a large map of Palestine, created with two million pieces of colored stone. The map shows hills and valleys, villages and towns as far as the Nile Delta, including a detailed map of Jerusalem as it was during the sixth century A.D. Other mosaic masterpieces found in Madaba include a rampant profusion of flowers and plants, birds and fish, animals and exotic beasts, as well as scenes from mythology and everyday pursuits of hunting, fishing and farming. This region has been significant throughout Biblical history: Only six miles west of Madaba is one of the traditional burial sites of Moses on Mount Nebo, known as Pisgah in the Bible. Mount Nebo, the Bible says, is where Moses lived out his remaining days looking out over the Promised Land that he would never enter. It offers a fantastic view westward, with a vista that includes the Dead Sea, the West Bank, the Jordan River and, on a clear day, Bethlehem and Jerusalem. After lunch continue to Petra. Before dinner hear from an expert on the life of the Nabateans, the nomadic Arabs who established Petra’s prominence as a trading hub.\nSpend the morning exploring Amman. Keep in mind that the area has been conquered and inhabited since Neolithic times and shows signs of its previous Greek, Roman and Ottoman inhabitants as well as its Muslim ones. Most of the city’s noteworthy historical sites are in the downtown area, which sits at the bottom of four of the city’s seven hills. The ancient Citadel, which towers above the capital from the top of Jabal al-Qala’a, is a good place to begin. The most impressive building of the Citadel, known simply as al-Qasr (the Palace), dates to the Islamic Umayyad period in the sixth and seventh centuries. Close to al-Qasr lie the remains of a small Byzantine basilica. Corinthian columns mark the site of the church, which is thought to date from the sixth or seventh century as well. Nearby is what is thought to have been a temple of Hercules, also known as the Great Temple of Amman, and the Jordan Archaeological Museum, a small museum that houses an excellent collection of antiquities ranging from prehistoric times to the 15th century. A five-minute walk away is the Roman theater, with two small museums built into its foundations: the Jordan Folklore Museum and the Museum of Popular Traditions. Visit a local sweet shop to taste kanafa, a traditional dessert made of cheese pastry and sweet syrup. After lunch visit the Desert Castles, or Qasrs, built in the seventh and eighth centuries as part of a chain stretching from north of Damascus down as far as Ariha, or Jericho. The lack of defensive architecture suggests that they were built as pleasure palaces, surrounded by artificial oases with fruit and vegetables as well as animals for hunting. Dinner is on your own.\nAfter breakfast, a short journey outside of Amman, through a lovely pine forest and olive groves, brings you to the town of Ajloun, where the Roman emperor Hadrian stayed from 129 to 130 A.D. Visit the 12th-century Ajloun Castle, a superb example of Islamic architecture occupying a strategic position and important link in the defensive chain against the Crusaders. The fortress is built on the hill above Ajloun, and offers a breathtaking view of the surrounding countryside. On a clear day you can see the Dead Sea, the Jordan Valley, the West Bank and the Sea of Galilee. Continue through the lovely hills of Gilead to Jerash to see some of the most magnificent and complete ruins of a provincial Roman city in the world. Jerash was buried under sand and rubble for centuries until its rediscovery in 1806, though proper excavation began only in 1925. In its prime, Jerash had a population of 15,000: Although the city was not on a major trade route, its citizens prospered from the fertile land in the surrounding area. Excavations have revealed two theaters, an unusual oval-shaped forum, temples, churches and baths. The ruins of Jerash show evidence of habitation going back to Neolithic times, then through the founding of the city by Alexander the Great’s soldiers around 332 B.C., on through Roman conquest in A.D. 63 to the Byzantine period, the city’s near-destruction by the Crusaders in the 12th century and on to its present-day settlement by the Circassians. The city shows evidence of all these different periods of history. After lunch, return to Amman. This afternoon, meet with the personal photographer of the late King Hussein and attend a brief talk. This evening attend a cocktail reception and welcome dinner at a local restaurant with magnificent views over the old city.\nArrive at Queen Alia International Airport in Amman, Jordan, where you will be met before immigration and assisted with airport formalities. Transfer to your hotel, with the rest of the day on your own.\nAnne Barnard, a veteran New York Times foreign correspondent, is currently the 2018-19 Edward R. Murrow Press Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Barnard led Times coverage of the devastating Syria war for six years, reporting from across the Middle East and living in Beirut as bureau chief from 2012-2018. She has explored almost all of our destinations -- for journalism, for tourism with her husband and two young children, or both.\nSince joining the New York Times in 1990, Roger Cohen has served as a foreign correspondent, foreign editor and columnist.

Visit many of the Roman, Greek and Islamic sites of ancient and modern Jordan and Lebanon. These two countries have had mixed relations with their neighbors, especially Syria and Israel, and with the United States. This specially designed trip, accompanied by a New York Times expert, will help you better understand these nations and their people.\nOn this 11-day journey to Jordan and Lebanon, enjoy extraordinary access to politicians, places and people as you learn to unravel the complicated pasts, presents and futures of these beguiling countries. Plus, visit Petra and spend a night in the desert. With local guides and a New York Times expert, help put this region in better perspective.\nTerms & Conditions\nThese are the terms under which we offer Times Journeys Tours.
