In another picture, about 15 men, women and children who were not painted looked up from thatched huts.\nSurvival International, an organization based in London whose mission is to help tribal peoples to “defend their lives, protect their lands and determine their own futures,” said the pictures were taken as part of several flights over the thinly populated upper reaches of the Amazon, in Acre, a Brazilian state.\nSome of the photographs are at www.survival-international.org.\nThe Brazilian government conducts such photographic operations to locate the scattered tribes and monitor their well-being.
