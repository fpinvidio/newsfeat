She said the couple “had dined at that restaurant because they felt safe there, because of where it was, close to the embassy, where they were married.”\nMarco Tondat\nMarco Tondat, 39, was supposed to return to Cordovado, a town in northern Italy, on Monday, three days after the attack, his brother Fabio said.\n“My brother was a good man, very resourceful, with a great desire to live,” Mr. Tondat said.\n“He left a year ago for this adventure, because it’s difficult to find work here. So he set off on an adventure, and unfortunately this is the epilogue.”\nVincenzo D’Allestro\nVincenzo D’Allestro, 46, was traveling in Bangladesh, said Raffaele Lettieri, the mayor of Acerra, near Naples, where Mr. D’Allestro lived with his wife, Maria Assunta Gaudio.\nShe was “distraught with grief,” Mr. Lettieri said. “She still can’t believe what happened.”\nMs. Gaudio usually traveled with her husband, Mr. Lettieri said, but this time he had traveled alone.\nNadia Benedetti\nNadia Benedetti, 52, had been living in Bangladesh for 25 years. She bonded quickly with Ms. Monti. They were part of a close-knit group of about 200 Italians living in Dhaka.\n“It’s a small community. We are all very close — we’re more like a family,” said Tullio Ferri, an Italian who lives in Dhaka and was a friend of eight of the nine Italian victims. “We are all about the same age, between 45 and 55, and many of us went two or three decades ago. We grew up together professionally.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/04/world/asia/dhaka-victims-were-a-diverse-group-of-global-citizens.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
