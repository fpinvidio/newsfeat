As a result, during the next decade, millions of immigrants who have been waiting patiently for legal documents will be united with their family members here.\nThe bill, an intricate combination of many interlocking parts, also provides a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally. Under the plan, those immigrants would wait at least 13 years before they could apply to become citizens.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/us/politics/house-democrats-present-immigration-overhaul-plan.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
