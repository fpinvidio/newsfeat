By Saturday evening, only around 200 people were left behind a fenced area on the line that separates the two countries.\nSome of the people who entered continued their trip north, toward the Serbian border, via taxis and private buses. But most headed toward the train station about three miles away in the border town of Gevgelija, joining more than 2,000 people there waiting for a train to Serbia and Hungary, and then on toward wealthier European countries.\nEarlier in the day, the Macedonian police used stun grenades in an effort to restore control and to return those who had managed to slip across the border in an area where the police presence was thinner and where there was no barbed wire. Officers gave chase as migrants ran through fields near Gevgelija, but because of their sheer numbers, many escaped. Some officers kicked migrants and beat them with batons, but humanitarian workers said there were no serious injuries.\nThe migrants, most of them fleeing violence in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, had grown impatient after spending most of Friday night in open fields under heavy rainfall, according to activists. About 4,000 migrants crossed into Macedonia on Saturday, including those who slipped beyond the police cordon and those allowed in later.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/world/europe/migrants-rush-across-border-in-macedonia.html?module=inline"}
