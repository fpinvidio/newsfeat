It has to fall, sooner rather than later, according to the less famous of the record’s co-holders.\n“Right now, we know we’ve been fortunate to still have it and probably won’t much longer,” said Donyell Marshall, who shares the mark of 12 3-pointers with Kobe Bryant, but with a notable distinction.\nThough Marshall was picked fourth in the 1994 draft by Minnesota, out of Connecticut, he was not a star. The night of his record dozen, he was not even a starter.\nIt was in March 2005 that Marshall, an 11-year veteran, came off the Toronto Raptors’ bench and staged a home-court clinic in corner shooting against the Philadelphia 76ers. He attempted a career-high 19 3-pointers and tied Bryant — who had made 12 of 18 for the Lakers against Seattle in January 2003 — with 2 minutes 52 seconds left in a 128-110 victory.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/sports/basketball/donyell-marshalls-3s-are-not-long-for-the-record-book.html"}
