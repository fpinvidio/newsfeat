There’s generous room for four, five if need be. It’s quiet, comfortable and comes with a lifetime battery warranty. And it is not the Toyota Prius.\nIt’s the Hyundai Ioniq (rhymes with iconic) Hybrid.\nThe King is dead. Long live the King.\nYes, Hyundai has out-Priused the Prius with the Ioniq. Specifically, the Ioniq Hybrid Blue model (available in many other colors) averages 58 miles per gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, two more than the Prius Eco. But Ioniq isn’t just a hybrid: There’s an all-electric model currently (no pun intended) exclusive to California and a plug-in hybrid version due later this year.\nI have driven the Electric and the base, at $23,035, Hybrid Blue. I’ll cut to the chase: These are exceptionally well-done vehicles that deserve to be on any fuel miser’s test-drive list. Buyers seem to be shunning ultraefficient cars for sport utility vehicles, but that’s another story.\nIoniq is a hatchback with an aerodynamic silhouette dictated by Mother Nature. I see hints of a Saab 900 without the droopy back end. Inside and out, Ioniq avoids the riotous lines of the Prius. I parked next to one and asked a dozen people to vote on looks. Ioniq won unanimously. The interior is straightforward, with the gauge cluster in front of the steering wheel.
