The storm knocked out Puerto Rico’s fragile power grid, exposing the island’s decrepit infrastructure and raising questions about its future viability amid a worsening economic crisis.\nIn Loíza, one of the coastal towns hit hardest by the hurricane, Javier Rivera and Lina Carrasquillo were still without power on Saturday.\nWater leaked into an assortment of pots and buckets they had scattered throughout the ground floor. The metal roof that once covered their second floor had blown away and crashed into a neighbor’s home. The couple had driven hours in search of generators, but they were sold out everywhere they looked.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/us/irma-puerto-rico-infrastructure.html?mcubz=3&module=inline"}
