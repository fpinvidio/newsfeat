Three weeks before it will take over, the party has yet to announce a program or plan of action for the new government. And even though it holds a majority of the seats in Parliament, which will elect the next president, it has yet to reveal its candidate.\n“We don’t want any controversy because of our predictions and our interviews,” said U Win Htein, a senior party member and one of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s closest advisers. “We just want to be low key.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/world/asia/aung-san-suu-kyi-finds-roadblocks-on-path-to-presidency.html?module=inline"}
