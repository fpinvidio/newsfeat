The office has an elaborate and lengthy process for considering pardon applications. It generally requires a five-year waiting period, the office’s application instructions say, “to afford the petitioner a reasonable period of time in which to demonstrate an ability to lead a responsible, productive and law-abiding life.”\nMr. Trump has acted more impulsively, bypassing the office and the care and deliberation followed by other presidents. He has also focused on prominent people, while other presidents often pardoned people not of particular notoriety.\nThe pardon office usually recommends pardons only after an expression of remorse. Not all of the people Mr. Trump has pardoned met that requirement. Mr. Arpaio, for instance, remained defiant.\n“A presidential pardon is ordinarily a sign of forgiveness,” the office’s instructions say. “A pardon is not a sign of vindication and does not connote or establish innocence. For that reason, when considering the merits of a pardon petition, pardon officials take into account the petitioner’s acceptance of responsibility, remorse and atonement for the offense.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/us/politics/pardons-trump.html?module=inline"}
