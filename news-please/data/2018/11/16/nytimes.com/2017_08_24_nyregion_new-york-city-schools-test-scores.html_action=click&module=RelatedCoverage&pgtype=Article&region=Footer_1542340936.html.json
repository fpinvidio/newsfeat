At those schools, the percentage of children who passed the reading tests increased by 3.2 points from last year; the percentage passing the math tests increased by 1.5 points. Citywide, reading proficiency increased by 2.6 percentage points and math proficiency grew by 1.4 points.\nBut a closer look at the performance of the elementary and middle schools in the program last school year — there were 57, five of which have closed or been merged with other schools — shows that those numbers mask a yawning divide among the schools, with some making impressive gains, while others languish. And almost all of them lag behind the city over all: On average, in reading, just 15.9 percent of Renewal students scored as proficient, compared to 40.6 percent citywide; in math, only 9.4 percent of Renewal students passed, compared to the citywide average of 37.8 percent.\nTo track the effects of the program, which gives schools a longer day and access to special services like vision care for students or mental heath supports, The New York Times analyzed Renewal school performance on the 2016 and 2017 tests, as compared with the 2015 scores.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/nyregion/new-york-city-schools-test-scores.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
