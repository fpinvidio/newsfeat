<p> Nobody knows just how many people are killed by the police nationwide. The F.B.I. keeps <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2014-preliminary-statistics-for-law-enforcement-officers-killed-in-the-line-of-duty">an official tally</a> of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty — an average of 69 per year since 1980 — but there is no comparable accounting of lives taken by officers. </p> <p> Yet a detailed review of news reports, official statements and websites that try to keep track of such things indicates that in the year since an officer fatally shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., on Aug. 9, 2014, 1,000 or more people died at the hands of law enforcement officers acting in the line of duty. </p> <p> That review reveals some expected patterns, like the disproportionate presence of African-Americans, people with mental illnesses, and young men among the dead. </p> <p> More surprising is how often the people killed seemed to be committing “suicide by cop,” either indicating in advance that they wanted to die, asking officers to shoot them, or simply preferring death to prison. In dozens of cases, a person was killed after brandishing some kind of toy gun, even pointing it at officers, a sure invitation to gunfire. </p> <p> Dozens of people, at least, died after being shocked with electric stun guns, some from compression or choking, and some from causes that remain mysterious. But most, by far, were shot. </p> <p> Another clear conclusion is that a great majority of the people killed were reported to be armed, and very often were attacking officers. Sometimes, there is only the officers’ word for that, but in most cases, their accounts are supported by witnesses or physical evidence. </p> <p>At times, the killing of <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/dekalb-police-respond-to-critics-of-officer-who-sh/nj55t/">an armed person</a> leads to protests and is called unjustified, or the killing of <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/communities/stillwater/stillwater-officer-who-shot-person-of-interest-in-homicide-is/article_ae84c1b7-19f6-5d20-b3e1-e5a47c953940.html">an unarmed person</a> is considered justified. </p> <p> But the presence or absence of a weapon is often, like video, a definitive factor in determining how the police, prosecutors and the public react. It is the fatal shootings, like those of Mr. Brown, Tamir Rice and Samuel DuBose, that prompt the greatest outrage. </p> <p>Here are some recent cases that drew the most attention or raised the most serious questions about the officers’ conduct.</p>

<p>A white rookie police officer shot and killed an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/us/police-request-fbi-help-in-texas-killing.html">unarmed black college football player</a> who the police said had broken into a car dealership in Arlington, a Dallas suburb. The police said the man, Christian Taylor, 19 — an Arlington native who was a football player and student at Angelo State University in San Angelo, a city in western Texas — was shot at around 1 a.m. on Aug. 7 as he was confronted by officers who had been sent to the dealership after reports of a burglary. The officer, Brad Miller, 49, was fired Aug. 11 for “inappropriate judgment” in his handling of the situation, officials said. The Arlington police chief, Will D. Johnson, said that Officer Miller's mistakes included entering the building without his more experienced partner. There were other officers at the scene, Chief Johnson told reporters, including Officer Miller’s partner, who tried to use a stun gun to subdue Mr. Taylor.</p>

<div class='listy_body'>
<p>A suspect in an armed robbery was <a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2015-08-06/police-describe-events-leading-fatal-shooting-rantoul-standoff.html">fatally shot</a> after a standoff at a motel, during which, officials said, the man told the police he had guns and threatened to shoot. Two days earlier, a man had held up a restaurant at gunpoint. From images taken by surveillance cameras, investigators tentatively identified him as Darius Graves, 31, and received a tip that he was at a Days Inn motel. Police officers from Rantoul and Champaign, Ill., spent nearly seven hours trying to get him to leave the room, but said he refused and repeatedly made threats. Finally, officers fired tear gas into the room, and Mr. Graves, who was black, crawled out, holding an object that officials said they thought was a weapon. Sgt. Colby Oleson, a Champaign SWAT team leader, fired a single shot from about 30 feet away, killing Mr. Graves. Officials said that Sergeant Oleson, who is white, had followed the plan laid out by commanders and that the shooting was justified. The object in Mr. Graves’s hand turned out to be a metal sink trap. There were no weapons on him or in the room, and officers did not find the money and valuables taken in the robbery.</p>

An Arby’s employee called 911 and reported a man causing a disturbance. The authorities said that on her way to the restaurant, a Plymouth police officer, Amy Therkelsen, was told that the man might be armed. When she arrived, customers were trying to subdue Mr. Wolfsteller, and the officer did, as well. Officials said he tried to take her gun, and she shot him.

<p>A campus police officer fatally shot a motorist during a traffic stop for a missing license plate, resulting in what prosecutors said was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/30/us/university-of-cincinnati-officer-indicted-in-shooting-death-of-motorist.html?_r=0">the first murder charge ever filed</a> in Hamilton County against an officer for actions taken on duty. The officer, Ray Tensing, of the University of Cincinnati police force, was patrolling away from the campus when he stopped the motorist, Samuel DuBose, 43. <a title="full video from prosecutor" href="http://www.hcpros.org/tensing">Video from a body camera</a> worn by Officer Tensing showed that he tried to get Mr. DuBose out of the car and reached in; that Mr. DuBose began to drive away; and that the officer fired one shot, hitting Mr. DuBose in the head. The county prosecutor, Joseph T. Deters, called the shooting "asinine" and said Mr. DuBose had not acted aggressively or posed a threat to Officer Tensing. The officer contended that he was dragged by the car. The murder charge is punishable by life in prison.</p>

<p>After a routine traffic stop, a Memphis police officer tried to arrest a man on outstanding warrants, fought with the man, and <a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/local-news/assessing-the-police-shooting-of-darrius-stewart_03813914">fatally shot him</a>. The officer, Connor Schilling, pulled over a car with a broken headlight. He gave the driver a ticket and asked the passenger for identification; the passenger gave his name, Darrius Stewart, but said he did not have identification with him. The driver of the car, Rickey Taylor, left on foot to retrieve Mr. Stewart’s driver’s license from his home nearby, and the officer put Mr. Stewart, 19, into the back seat of his patrol car. A dispatcher told Officer Schilling that there were two warrants for Mr. Stewart in other states, both issued when he was 13. According to the police, the officer then tried to get Mr. Stewart out of the car in order to handcuff and arrest him. They said Mr. Stewart kicked the car door open, took the handcuffs, hit Officer Schilling with them and ran. The officer caught Mr. Stewart, and a physical struggle followed, partly captured on video. Mr. Stewart was black. Officer Schilling is white.</p>

Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies went to the neighborhood after a report of a prowler going door to door, asking to be let in. Johnny Ray Anderson, 43, and his wife, Kathleen, had been squatting illegally in a vacant house. His wife said he had been in the driveway fixing a bicycle when he saw the deputies and decided to run, jumping fences into neighboring yards. A short time later, officials said, Mr. Anderson surprised one deputy and tried to take his gun, and the deputy shot him once in the chest. A lawyer for his family said that when Mr. Anderson was shot, he was too far away to pose any threat, much less take the gun. Mr. Anderson was white.

Pleasanton police officers responded to a burglary call and could see Mr. Deming inside the dealership, jumping on cars, officials said. They said when officers entered, Mr. Deming went to a back room and out a window, and then turned and fought with Officer Daniel Kunkel, beating the officer almost to unconsciousness. Officer Kunkel used his stun gun to no avail, they said, and then shot Mr. Deming three times. Mr. Deming’s family contends that police radio traffic shows that only 22 seconds passed from when officers entered the dealership to when Mr. Deming was shot — not enough time for all of that to happen. They have also questioned the severity of the injuries sustained by Officer Kunkel, who spent less than a day in the hospital. Mr. Deming was white, as is Officer Kunkel.</p>

Judson, fled on foot; officials said he was later found to be in possession of methamphetamine. Soon after Mr. Judson ran off, a second deputy, Richard Broyles, arrived in another patrol car and chased him down. In the struggle that followed, partly captured on video, Mr. Judson, 24, got into the driver’s seat of Deputy Broyles’s car. The deputy’s arm got caught in the door, and he fired twice at close range. The deputy broke free, and Mr. Judson began to drive off in reverse. As he pulled away and backed into a utility pole, the deputy fired twice more from several yards away. The district attorney ruled that Deputy Broyles’s actions were justified.

Later, officers managed to box him between two police cars. He got out again and “walked with a purpose” toward the car driven by Officer Vanessa Miller, a police spokesman said.

She told a local television station, KOAT, that her son, who had spent time in jail, punched the deputy and said, “You’re not taking me back.” After the deputy drew his gun and told Mr. Baca to calm down, she said, he took a step toward the deputy, who fired. The deputy’s name and race were not released. Mr. Baca was Hispanic.</p>

<p>Officers <a href="http://www.kltv.com/story/29409255/no-charges-filed-against-palestine-police-officers-in-officer-involved-shooting">shot and killed</a> a suspect in a theft who had pointed a realistic-looking BB gun at them. Sgt. Gabriel Green and Officer Kaylynn Griffin of the Palestine police responded to a report that a man had stolen beer from a Walmart store and then gone to an Applebee’s restaurant. They found a suspect, James D. Bushey, in a restaurant bathroom and escorted him outside. As they were trying to identify him, he drew the pellet gun and pointed it at the officers. The episode was captured on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/verify_controversy?next_url=/watch%3Fv%3D0V9AOsWQzpc%26oref%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252Fwatch%253Fv%253D0V9AOsWQzpc%26has_verified%3D1">video from body cameras</a> worn by the officers.

<p>A deputy <a href="http://verdenews.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1190&amp;ArticleID=65985">fatally shot a man</a> who had fled on foot after a traffic stop and then reportedly fought with the deputy. There was a warrant out for the arrest of the man, Ebin Proctor, 18, for violating his probation on a previous conviction. When a car he was in was pulled over before dawn by a Yavapai County sheriff’s deputy, Steven Gorman, Mr. Proctor gave the deputy a false name and then ran. The deputy caught Mr. Proctor, who the sheriff’s office said fought when the deputy tried to subdue him. A stun gun and pepper spray were ineffective, the office said, and Mr. Proctor tried to take Deputy Gorman’s gun, so the deputy shot him. Mr. Proctor was white, as is Deputy Gorman.</p>

The officers tried to make a routine traffic stop, but the man — Frank Shephard III, known as Trey, who had an outstanding arrest warrant — sped away. His mother has said that during the pursuit, he called her and told her he loved her, and refused to follow her advice to stop the car. He also called 911 to say that there was a child in the car, which was untrue. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybyc0PLF4SE">Video</a> of the last minutes of the chase shows him coming to a stop after ramming a small car, whose driver was injured, and a sport-utility vehicle.

Tulsa County sheriff’s deputies were about to arrest the man, Eric Courtney Harris, 44, on a charge of illegal gun sale, but Mr. Harris, who had an extensive criminal history, fled on foot. Among those who chased him down was the reserve deputy, Robert Charles Bates, 73, who is white. A deputy wearing a body camera knocked Mr. Harris, who was black, to the ground, but officials say he continued to resist as he lay face-down in the street. In <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/crimewatch/video-of-fatal-shooting-by-reserve-deputy-shown-at-sheriff/article_9d77cce0-75e6-5ddf-a782-cf048ad4064b.html">a video</a> of the episode, a voice, apparently that of Mr. Bates, can be heard saying “Taser,” as if to warn other deputies that he is about to shock the suspect. Then there is a single gunshot, and a voice says, “Oh, I shot him, I’m sorry.” Mr. Harris can be heard repeatedly shouting, “He shot me,” while a deputy kneels on his head and others yell at him to stop struggling. It later emerged that Mr. Bates might not have had the training required for his post, and questions were raised about whether his qualifications had been falsified. Critics said he had been allowed to hold the position only because he was a friend of the sheriff's and had donated expensive equipment to the department. Mr. Bates has been charged with second-degree manslaughter.</p>

The videos show four officers forcing him to the ground. The clicking of a stun gun can be heard, followed by at least five gunshots. The authorities have not said how many officers fired, and the Los Angeles Police Department has not released video from the officers' body cameras. But a journalist who viewed at least some of that footage <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/skid-row-police-shooting-charly-keunang">wrote in GQ magazine</a> that it contradicted accounts the officers had given to investigators. Mr. Keunang, who was from Cameroon and was known as Africa, was black. The officers, who have not been officially identified, are of various ethnicities.</p>

Four officers responding to reports of the robbery confronted Daniel Elrod, 39, two blocks away. The police said he had climbed onto a car, ignored commands to get down on the ground and repeatedly reached toward his waistband. Officers and <a href="http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/One-Week-Later-Officer-Involved-Shooting-Witness-Speaks-294757771.html">witnesses</a> said he had dared the police to shoot him. When Mr. Elrod turned and grabbed a fence, Officer Alvin Lugod fired at him. Mr. Elrod had an extensive criminal history, and Officer Lugod had arrested him on a domestic violence charge a month earlier. He had been released from jail a few hours before the shooting. There was also long trail of evidence that he was <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/crime/repeated-talk-of-suicidal-thoughts-didn-t-elicit-help-for/article_e9b7b01d-8ea9-53a1-bb16-cabec11f9b05.html">distraught and suicidal</a>.

<p>A Grapevine police officer <a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/crime/article11225840.html">fatally shot</a> an unarmed man who had led the officer on a chase but had then stopped. The man, Rubén García Villalpando, raised his hands and got out of his car in response to commands from the officer, Robert W. Clark. But video <a href="http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/05/tarrant-county-grand-jury-declined-to-indict-in-grapevine-police-involved-shooting-of-mexican-immigrant.html/">video taken by a dashboard camera</a> in Officer Clark's patrol car also shows Mr. García repeatedly defying commands to keep his hands up and to stay by his own car. Instead, he repeatedly steps toward the officer, ignoring orders to back up. Officer Clark fired two shots into his chest, which can be heard on the recording but not seen. Tests later showed that Mr. García, 31, was legally drunk. Officer Clark had responded to a burglar alarm at a closed business and had seen a car in the parking lot that drove off as he approached. He pursued the car with his lights and sirens on. The pursuit ended in nearby Euless, where Mr. García, a Mexican national, stopped on the shoulder of a highway. A grand jury cleared the officer of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>A Salt Lake City officer responding to a report of young men brandishing a gun <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/58472404-78/taylor-cruz-hands-gill.html.csp">shot and killed</a> an unarmed man who failed to comply with commands and appeared to reach toward his waist. Outside a convenience store, officers confronted the man, Dillon Taylor, 20, and his brother and cousin, who the police said fit the description in a 911 call of the three men flashing a gun. The other two men stopped and raised their hands, but Mr. Taylor kept walking away from the officers. He was wearing earbuds, and his family members have said he could not hear the police commands. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1UjKqzVDCw">Video taken</a> by a body camera worn by Officer Bron Cruz shows Mr. Taylor raising his hands to his waist and the officer, his gun drawn, yelling, “Get your hands out now!” Mr. Taylor turns to face Officer Cruz and, walking backward, continues to move away from him. He appears to lift his T-shirt with one hand, and Officer Cruz fires. The police said Mr. Taylor’s gestures had suggested that he was drawing a gun; his brother said he had been hiking up his pants. Neither Mr. Taylor nor his companions were armed. It later emerged that Mr. Taylor was drunk at the time and that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest. The district attorney called the shooting justified. Mr. Taylor was white; Officer Cruz's race and ethnicity have not been released.</p>

Officers found him again a short time later, and rather than surrender, officials said, Mr. Evans ran to his vehicle, retrieved the pellet gun and pointed it at the officers. Officer Zach Lazenby of the Provo Police Department and Deputy Chris Bagley of the Utah County Sheriff’s Office fired a total of three shots. Mr. Evans was white, as are the officers.</p>

The officers went to the scene in response to a report of a man throwing rocks at passing cars, and the police say the man, Antonio Zambrano-Montes, hit some officers with rocks. There have been conflicting statements about whether Mr. Zambrano-Montes had a mental illness. A video taken by a bystander shows him standing near the officers, throwing an object at them or their car, and then moving away from them across a busy street. Two officers can be seen firing at him a few times as he retreats, and then all three give chase. Seconds later, he turns to face them while lifting an object in his hand, and all three officers open fire. Mr. Zambrano-Montes, who was Hispanic, drops the object and falls to the sidewalk, his body turning away from the officers as he falls; a couple of shots can be heard after he is down. In all, as many as seven bullets hit him. His family has said two rounds struck him in the back, while the police say none did; each side has cited <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/autopsy-reports-differ-in-shooting-death-of-pasco-farmworker/">its own autopsy</a>.

The episode began with an attempted traffic stop in Hummelstown, just east of Harrisburg, for expired inspection stickers. Officer Lisa Mearkle of the Hummelstown Police Department tried to pull over the suspect, David Kassick, 59, but he sped away to his sister’s house, where he had been living, and then ran around to the back of the house with Officer Mearkle chasing him. Though it is not clear why he fled, Mr. Kassick had a history of drug addiction and criminal convictions, and officials said a syringe was found near his body. Officer Mearkle’s <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/03/what_was_she_supposed_to_do_li.html">lawyer said</a> Mr. Kassick had refused repeated commands to stop and raise his hands.

She shot him twice in the back. The district attorney has charged Officer Mearkle with homicide, saying that a video, not yet made public, shows that Mr. Kassick’s moves were not threatening.

Mr. Caffarello was white, as is Officer Drehobl.</p>

<div class='listy_body'>
<p>An officer who fired at a dog he said was attacking him proceeded to <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2015/03/24/burlington-police-fatal-shooting-body-cameras/70373048/">fatally shoot</a> one of the animal’s owners, who was unarmed. Gabriel Steele called 911 to report that his wife, Autumn, was assaulting him at their home. She had been arrested the day before after allegedly assaulting him, and a court had ordered her to have no contact with him. According to a <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2015/03/24/burlington-police-fatal-shooting-body-cameras/70373048/">police investigation</a>, Officer Jesse Hill responded to the 911 call, and saw Mr. Steele leaving the home with the couple's 4-year-old child in his arms while Ms. Steele followed, hitting him. Investigators reported that Officer Hill was trying separate them when the family dog charged him and bit him. In a brief, jumbled video, he can be heard saying, “Hey, get your dog,” before firing two shots. One bullet grazed Ms. Steele, 34, and the other struck her in the chest. She was white, as is the officer, who was cleared of wrongdoing.</p>

<div class='listy_body'>
<p>Members of a United States Marshals Service task force <a href="http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/7750969-74/deputy-dwyer-sapp#axzz3hmZZMK8L">shot and killed</a> Leslie Sapp, who they said had approached them holding a realistic-looking pellet gun. The task force had gone to the home of Mr. Sapp, who was a fugitive wanted on a charge of raping a child, to arrest him. One task force member, an Allegheny County sheriff’s deputy, tested positive for cocaine and was fired. The district attorney found the shooting justified. Mr. Sapp was black. The deputy was white; the identities and races of the other task force members have not been made public.</p>

<p>Officers <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Motive-sought-after-S-F-cops-kill-man-with-5995305.php">fatally shot</a> a man with a BB gun who officials said had wanted the police to kill him. The man, Matthew Hoffman, 32, had written suicide notes on his phone, apologizing to the officers involved, according to the San Francisco Police Department. Mr. Hoffman walked into the parking lot of a police station, an area that is off-limits to the public, and when confronted by three sergeants, he drew a BB gun, the department said. Two of the sergeants fired, hitting him three times.</p>

</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p>While investigating a report of a possible burglary, a Texarkana police officer <a href="http://www.ktbs.com/story/27645055/neighbors-react-to-deadly-officer-involved-shooting?clienttype=mobile">shot and killed</a> an unarmed man who he said had advanced on him while holding a metal object, which turned out to be a spoon. Residents whose home had been burglarized before heard noises in their garage. They say that they called out to the intruder to leave but that he began banging on a window, so they called the police. The man turned out to be Dennis Grigsby, 35, who was living across the street with his mother and had a history of mental illness; his mother said he had been barefoot and wearing pajamas when he died. The officer, Brent Lawing, who found him in the dimly lit garage, said Mr. Grigsby had moved toward him aggressively and refused orders to stop. He fired once, striking Mr. Grigsby in the chest. Mr. Grigsby was black; the race of Officer Lawing, who was cleared of wrongdoing, was not disclosed.<br></p>

<div class='listy_body'>
<p>An unarmed man bringing food home from McDonald’s for his family <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/us/phoenix-officer-who-shot-black-suspect-mistook-pill-bottle-for-gun-authorities-say.html">was fatally shot</a> by a Phoenix police officer, who may have mistaken a pill bottle he felt in the man’s pocket for the handle of a gun. The police said that the officer, Mark Rine, had been investigating a report of drug dealing when he approached the man — Rumain Brisbon, 34, who was sitting in his S.U.V. — and that Mr. Brisbon had tried to run away, toward his apartment. Officials said that the men struggled and that when Mr. Brisbon put a hand in his pocket, Officer Rine put his own hand over Mr. Brisbon’s and felt a hard, cylindrical object. Fearing that it was a gun and unable to keep his grip, officials said, he shot Mr. Brisbon twice. Officer Rine, who was <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/04/01/phoenix-police-rumain-brisbon-autopsy-release-abrk/70777818/">cleared of wrongdoing</a>, is white; Mr. Brisbon was black. Searches of the apartment and the vehicle later turned up a stash of oxycodone, a stolen handgun and a large amount of cash.</p>

Tamir Rice

<div class='listy_headline'>
Nov. 22, 2014 — Cleveland
</div>
<div class='listy_body'>
<p>A rookie officer shot an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/us/boy-12-dies-after-being-shot-by-cleveland-police-officer.html">unarmed 12-year-old boy</a> who had been pointing a toy gun at people in a park. A 911 caller had complained about the boy, Tamir Rice, but had said twice that the gun was probably not real. A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/27/us/video-shows-cleveland-officer-shot-tamir-rice-2-seconds-after-pulling-up-next-to-him.html">video</a> released by the Cleveland Police Department showed a police car pulling to a stop a few feet away from Tamir, who was black. Within two seconds, the officer in the passenger seat, Timothy Loehmann, who is white, had fired. For several minutes, neither Officer Loehmann nor the driver, Officer Frank Garmback, who is also white, administered first aid. When Tamir's 14-year-old sister tried to go to his aid, the officers forced her to the ground and handcuffed her. It later emerged that Officer Loehmann had resigned from another police department after a supervisor found him emotionally unfit for law enforcement work. A judge later <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/us/judge-finds-probable-cause-to-charge-officers-in-tamir-rice-death.html?_r=0">found probable cause</a> to charge Officer Loehmann with manslaughter and Officer Garmback with negligent homicide. The case is being presented to a grand jury.</p>

The man, Akai Gurley, 28, was hit once in the chest by a bullet that apparently ricocheted off a wall; a lawyer for the officer, Peter Liang, has said he fired by accident. Officials said Mr. Gurley was not suspected of any crime and did not pose a threat, and it was not clear why Officer Liang had his gun drawn. Mr. Gurley was black; Officer Liang, who <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/11/nyregion/akai-gurley-shooting-death-officer-indicted.html">has been charged</a> with manslaughter, is Asian-American.</p>

<p>A correction officer <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/family-deceased-high-desert-inmate-shocked-gunshot-wounds-body">fatally shot</a> an unarmed, handcuffed inmate and wounded another, who was also unarmed and handcuffed. Prison officials said the officer opened fire after the inmate who was killed, Carlos M. Perez Jr., 28, and the other inmate, Andrew J. Arevalo, got into a fight at High Desert State Prison. Both men had their hands cuffed behind their backs. Prison officials have said little about what happened, but the Clark County coroner reported that Mr. Perez had been shot several times, in the head, neck, chest and arms. Mr. Arevalo was also shot, but he survived. The state attorney general's office is looking into the episode. Mr. Perez was Hispanic. The officer’s name and ethnicity have not been made public.</p>

<p>An unarmed man who had just entered his home was <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27513820/rocky-ford-cop-pleads-not-guilty-murder-charge">fatally shot in the back</a> by a Rocky Ford police officer who later said he thought the man, Jack Jacquez, 27, was a burglar. The killing led to a second-degree murder charge against the officer, James Ashby, whose trial is pending. It was the first time in two decades that a law enforcement officer in Colorado faced such a serious charge for an on-duty killing. Officer Ashby told investigators that he thought Mr. Jacquez had broken into the house and was going to attack him with a baseball bat. But investigators said that he never identified himself as an officer and that Mr. Jacquez was never a threat to him. Mr. Jacquez was Hispanic. Mr. Ashby is white.</p>

Officials said that Deputy Norman identified himself when he knocked and that Cameron answered the door holding a BB gun, which was found at the scene. Cameron’s friends have said that they did not hear the deputy identify himself and that the boy was not holding the gun. Cameron was black, as is Deputy Norman.</p>

<p><strong></strong>Two officers <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/23/us/despite-similar-shootings-steps-by-los-angeles-police-temper-reaction.html">shot and killed</a> an unarmed man who they said had tried to take a gun from one of them. The man, Ezell Ford, 25, who was described by family and neighbors as mentally ill, was walking on a sidewalk when two officers in a police car stopped to question him. <a href="http://www.lapdonline.org/newsroom/news_view/56794">A report</a> issued by the Los Angeles Police Department said Mr. Ford “continued walking and made suspicious movements, including attempting to conceal his hands.” When Officer Sharlton Wampler tried to detain him, Mr. Ford fought, forced the officer to the ground and tried to take his gun, officials said. Officer Wampler and Officer Antonio Villegas both fired at Mr. Ford, hitting him three times. The Police Department called the shooting justified, and neither officer was disciplined. But the city's civilian Police Commission found fault with Officer Wampler, saying he had no justification for detaining Mr. Ford. Mr. Ford was black; Officer Wampler is Asian-American, and Officer Villegas is Hispanic.</p>
