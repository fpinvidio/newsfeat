I was on my way to an opening at a small art gallery. I didnâ€™t have my iPhone; even if I had, I never would have found the place.\nI asked a young man for help. He was probably in his mid-20s. He found the appropriate map on his phone and showed me the way.\nWhen he saw that I was having difficulty following his directions, he offered to escort me. I thanked him profusely, and when we arrived at the gallery I told him to tell his mother, from me, that she had raised a lovely son.\nHe asked if I would tell her. I said I would be delighted to.\nHe dialed her number, and told her that he was with someone who wanted to talk to her. He put me on the phone, and she and I had a lovely conversation.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/nyregion/metropolitan-diary-one-mother-to-another.html?module=inline"}
