It was one of the group’s most aggressive forays into the capital.\nA militia operating out of the air base successfully rebuffed the attack, killing all or most of the attackers, according to spokesmen for the Tripoli government.\nA group calling itself the Tripolitania Province of the Islamic State released a statement claiming responsibility for the assault, saying the aim was to free prisoners held at the facility. The group said its fighters “clashed with the guards and killed and wounded many of them.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/19/world/middleeast/isis-group-attacks-prison-in-libya.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
