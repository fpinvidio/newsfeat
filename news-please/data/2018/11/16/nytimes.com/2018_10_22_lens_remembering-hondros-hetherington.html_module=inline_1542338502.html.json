Both were on the government-controlled side of Monrovia, a city perched on a peninsula where rebels lobbed mortars into densely populated areas from across a bridge. Both sides relied on ragtag bands of drugged up child soldiers.\n“It was kids in T-shirts and flip-flops as high as kites,” said Mr. Kamber, who worked for weeks amid the chaos alongside Mr. Hondros. “It was a kind of madness.”\nDocumenting the conflict from the rebel side was British photographer Tim Hetherington, connected to his two friends across the front line by only the arc of projectiles.\n“I’m sure Tim had pictures of rebels firing mortars, and Chris and I were in the other part of town where the mortars were landing and killing civilians,” said Mr. Kamber, who compared photos with Mr. Hetherington after the war.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/lens/remembering-hondros-hetherington.html?module=inline"}
