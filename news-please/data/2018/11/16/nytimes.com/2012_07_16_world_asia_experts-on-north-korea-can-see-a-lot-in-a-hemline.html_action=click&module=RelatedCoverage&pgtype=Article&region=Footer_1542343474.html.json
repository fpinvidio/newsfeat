The world knows precious little about Mr. Kim, including exactly how old he is (the best guess is in his 20s) and whether he is married (news reports helpfully point out that a mystery woman making increasingly frequent appearances with him might be his sister, wife or girlfriend). But figuring out what he might be thinking is critical to determining how much of a threat he, and the nuclear program he inherited, poses to his neighbors, and North Korea’s enemies in the West.\nSo far, the puzzle pieces leave little doubt that Mr. Kim is trying to forge a very different leadership style than his father, Kim Jong-il, whose countenance was dour enough to merit ribbing by the creators of South Park. The son, by comparison, appears to be more approachable (photos show him hooking arms with factory workers and soldiers); less threatened by foreign cultures and apparently more willing to admit failure (he told the nation of a botched rocket launch in April).\nBut there is also ample evidence that Mr. Kim, who took over late last year after his father’s death, does not plan to veer far from his father’s and grandfather’s governing policies on most issues, including maintaining a strong military and nuclear arms program and issuing frequent, florid threats against South Korea and the United States. Mr. Kim launched the rocket in April despite the likelihood that it would kill a new food aid agreement with the United States, which it did, and annoy the North’s last true ally, China, which had urged restraint.\nIt became clear early on that Mr. Kim aimed to style himself after his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the more popular founder of the country, rather than his father. The youngest Mr. Kim claps his hands the same way his grandfather did and sports a similar hairdo with high-trimmed sideburns. In recent weeks, he hosted a huge children’s day celebration, ensuring he would be seen surrounded by happy and well-fed youngsters, just as his grandfather often was depicted in state propaganda.\nBut over time, Kim Jong-un has also begun to carve out his own leadership style, striving to come across as youthful and more pragmatic.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He was even shown visiting restaurants that sell pizza, hamburgers and French fries — Western foods that began appearing in Pyongyang several years ago but were not fully endorsed by his father.\nThen came this month’s concert, clips of which were later shown on state TV. The appearance of Mickey Mouse, a stand-in for Western culture, had a special resonance for those who have followed the Kim family dynasty.\nPhoto\nIn 2001, Kim Jong-il’s eldest son, Jong-nam, was caught trying to enter Japan with a fake visa, reportedly to visit Tokyo Disneyland. Analysts say Kim Jong-il was so upset that he effectively counted Jong-nam out as his successor.\nAt the concert, Kim Jong-un was essentially bringing Disneyland home, showing to his people that he was ready to embrace elements of foreign culture, even from the “sworn enemy” of the United States, if they suited his country’s needs, analysts said.\nThe changes are also meant to blunt the impact of more information and entertainment trickling into the North — from defectors who smuggle cellphones to their loved ones and from traders allowed to cross back and forth into China to get much-needed goods to sell, as well as digital copies of South Korean movies and television shows.\nPragmatism may also be driving what could be Mr. Kim’s most substantive change yet — a reported agreement to send thousands of skilled workers to China. The program, which has not been confirmed by either government, has been widely reported in China, and is a bold and potentially risky shift. With larger numbers going abroad, analysts said, North Korea will have less of a chance to monitor the workers as closely, but Mr. Kim appears willing to take the chance to shore up badly depleted foreign currency reserves with the fees it will charge workers chosen for the jobs.\nStill, for those ready to declare a true shift under Mr. Kim, it may be helpful to look back to another period of change that, as it turns out, also had a fashion angle.\nWhen the North’s economy was imploding in the 1990s, Kim Jong-il turned a blind eye to the decision by many women to break the North’s rules on clothing and behavior, wearing pants and biking to trading bazaars, creating an “eyesore.”\nBut in 2009, in an apparent fit of pique at the growing power of the merchants, Mr. Kim temporarily shut the black markets and the authorities resumed their crackdown on women wearing pants and riding bicycles. Then pants and markets made a comeback in 2010.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nSuch wild pendulum swings are likely to continue despite the change in leadership. “Under Kim Jong-un,” said Dong Yong-seung, a North Korea expert at the Samsung Economic Research Institute here, “we will see a continual clash and compromise between emerging market forces and the regime’s attempt to turn back the clock.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/world/asia/experts-on-north-korea-can-see-a-lot-in-a-hemline.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
