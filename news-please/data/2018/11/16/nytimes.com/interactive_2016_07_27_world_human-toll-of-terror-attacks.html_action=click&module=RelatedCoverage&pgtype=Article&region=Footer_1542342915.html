          <strong> Correction: July 30, 2016 </strong> <br/>
          <p>An&#160;article&#160;on Wednesday about the victims of terror attacks around the world during two weeks in March referred incorrectly to some of the perpetrators. The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, a Marxist group in Turkey that broke off from the Kurdistan Workers&#8217; Party, claimed responsibility for the bombing of a public square in Ankara, the capital, on March 13; not all of the perpetrators were Islamist extremists.</p>
