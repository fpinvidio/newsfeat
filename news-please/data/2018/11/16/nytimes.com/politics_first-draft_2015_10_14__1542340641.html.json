Finishing the interview, he was greeted by a swell of reporters and cameras, and he answered questions about what he wished had been talked about in the debate.\nAs he made his way toward the exit, and hotel security guards tried to clear a path, cameras and reporters kept cycling to the front, eventually bringing the scrum to a halt near the door while he continued to answer questions.\nThen, as he exited the hall to yet another scrum, and the mass of slow moving feet turned into pushing and elbowing as cameras jockeyed for position, Mr. Sanders had had enough.\n“Excuse me,” he shouted, a hand raised in the air. “Please move. Stop this.”\nThe herd only swelled further. So Mr. Sanders placed a hand on the back of a security guard, and started to make for the exit. But his pace was too quick, and his wife was stuck back in the stampede of reporters and cameramen.\nHe stopped his entourage. “Jane,” he yelled.\nShe was escorted quickly to the front of the line, and they made their way through a few rooms before escaping into an elevator.\nBut the candidate wasn’t rattled. He told reporters as he was leaving that he was “feeling great,” and joked, “Well, I think there is some interest, and maybe some people think we did O.K. tonight.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/14/bernie-sanders-is-briefly-trapped-in-post-debate-scrum/"}
