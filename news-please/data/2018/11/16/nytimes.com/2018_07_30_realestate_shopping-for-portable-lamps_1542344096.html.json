But they are also useful indoors, as bedside lamps that can light the path to the bathroom or the kitchen in the middle of the night.\nIn recent years, Mr. Orsman said, “the technology has become so much better,” with lamps that provide a more pleasing color of light, brighter output and better battery life.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/realestate/shopping-for-portable-lamps.html"}
