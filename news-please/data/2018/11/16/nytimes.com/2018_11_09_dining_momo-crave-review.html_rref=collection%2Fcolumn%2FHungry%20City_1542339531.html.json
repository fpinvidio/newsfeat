Momos may be plump as pincushions, swelling at the seams; or half-moons pleated so meticulously, they look carved; or hulks, furrowed and looming, small-scale analogues to the Himalayan peaks where they were born.\nWhatever the dumplingsâ€™ size, their skins are delicate enough that, when steamed, the shadow of the filling shows through: sometimes meat, sometimes a jade pulse of chives, but always seething, with juices on the run.\nAnd then there are the deep-fried momos at Momo Crave, just off the 7 train on the border of Woodside and Jackson Heights, Queens. They are dark orange-red globes with skins gone crisp, thrust on a skewer like tandoori chicken. They also taste like tandoori chicken, earthy and fervid, with a cool touch of yogurt and swallowed smoke from the grill.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/dining/momo-crave-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2FHungry%20City"}
