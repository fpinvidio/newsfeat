You may have certain ingredients on hand and a general notion of the outcome, but not necessarily a plan for getting there.\nThat’s part of the fun of cooking: leaving room for spur-of-the-moment ideas, or even a shift in direction.\nI had a nice boneless lamb shoulder roast, and first thought of steaming it to tenderness in the Moroccan style and eating it with harissa oil, toasted crushed cumin and coarse salt. Or I could have prepared it in a more French manner, studding it with garlic, rubbing it with rosemary and thyme and roasting it medium-rare. It’s an easy dinner, and the shoulder roast, to me, is tastier than the leaner and pricier hind leg.\nWhat I really wanted, though, was something brothy and stewlike. I appreciate soups, stews and braises year-round, but warmer weather calls for a lighter approach.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/dining/lamb-stew-recipe.html"}
