Saudi Arabiaâ€™s government implemented new crowd-control and security measures in recent years, but the most significant efforts have been focused on the bridge and train system, not on the area where the stampede took place.\nSurveillance A video analytics system was installed in 2006, but it is focused on monitoring the train system and the Jamarat Bridge, and it does not cover the area of the stampede.\nExpansion The five-level Jamarat Bridge was expanded in 2007 in response to a 2006 stampede that killed more than 360 people. It allows up to 250,000 people to cross the bridge each hour.\nSecurity Saudi Arabia deployed 100,000 security personnel throughout hajj sites. The security headquarters are among the tents of Mina, near the site of the stampede.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/09/24/world/middleeast/mecca-mina-stampede-hajj-maps.html?module=inline"}
