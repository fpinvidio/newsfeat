Yahoo Mail is one of the oldest free email services, and many users have built their digital identities around it, from their bank accounts to photo albums and even medical information.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/technology/yahoo-hackers.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
