Cluster bombs are banned by much of the world for the danger they pose to civilians. Ordnance spreads over a wide area and can leave behind unexploded bomblets. The United States, Saudi Arabia and Yemen have not joined an international treaty banning their use.</p>

            <p class="g-intro">The Saudi-led airstrikes crippled Yemen’s Houthi-controlled air force, but have so far failed to halt growing Houthi control on the ground. Military operations have severely limited humanitarian assistance in Yemen, a nation already burdened with hundreds of thousands of refugees. More than 1,000 people have died since the bombing began, most of them civilians. The United Nations estimates that at least 300,000 people have been displaced, forced to hunt for food and fuel in a country bereft of both.</p>

Since 2009, the United States has carried out at least 100 airstrikes in Yemen, according to an analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which has done a detailed analysis of strikes there.</p><p class='g-intro'></p><p class='g-intro'>Al Qaeda is not the only terrorist group operating in Yemen. In late March, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for bombings at two Shiite mosques in Sana that killed more than 135 people. The presence of ISIS could drive Yemen into a “full-blown sectarian conflict,” said Katherine Zimmerman, an analyst for the American Enterprise Institute. “What ISIS wants to do is to recreate in Yemen the sectarian war its predecessor, Al Qaeda in Iraq, stoked there.”</p>

There are reports that Houthi fighters have been firing at protestors in towns they enter. There are also reports of snipers shooting at civilians at Aljumhori Hospital in the Crater Region of Aden. It is not clear now to what extent these civilians engaged in acts of aggression against the rebels, which would change the ILH perspective. It seems that some civilians were engaged in the fighting against advancing Houthi fighters. Casualties: No clear number on casualties. Medécins Sans Frontieres is cited as stating that it has received over 500 injured in Aden hospital since beginning of fighting. On April 4th, the head of Aden’s health department, Al-Khader Lassouar, is said to have told AFP that by midnight on Friday, 185 deaths and 1,282 injuries had been registered at the city’s hospitals. Three quarters of them are said to be civilians.

Several days earlier, airstrikes had hit private homes, the post office, a community centre, Government offices, markets and vehicles. No verified casualty estimates have been reported, but local partners estimate at least 50 people killed and more than 100 injured. Airstrikes have targeted districts outside the Sa’adah city. Communications infrastructure has been affected, complicating efforts to consolidate and verify reports. Thousands of people have reportedly fled affected areas in recent days despite soaring transportation costs due to fuel shortages and insecurity. Those unable to flee include the most vulnerable, some of whom are reportedly staying in the open in areas of As Safra and Sahara Districts.
