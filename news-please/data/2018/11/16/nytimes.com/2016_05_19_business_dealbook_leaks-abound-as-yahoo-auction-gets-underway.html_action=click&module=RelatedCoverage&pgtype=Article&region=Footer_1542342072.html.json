An early leak can destroy a deal by driving the share price of the target company too high or by alerting other potential bidders.\nAs a result, deal makers are known for their secrecy, using code names and holding clandestine meetings. In the 1980s, it was not uncommon for law firms to sweep for bugs and for arbitrageurs to camp outside law firm offices to try to figure out who would be the next hostile raider target.\nSecrets are not always kept, to be sure; in fact, leaks in deal-making are an art form practiced for a variety of purposes. It may just be about a lawyer or a banker cozying up to a journalist. In Britain, it is standard practice to do a “leak announcement” at the start of a negotiation, as bankers are known for regularly leaking deals. It is not quite like that in the United States, but there is a steady stream of dialogue among lawyers, bankers and journalists. After all, they are all in this game together and are likely to see each other again in the next big deal.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/business/dealbook/leaks-abound-as-yahoo-auction-gets-underway.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
