Two died in a hospital, but the other six died in the camp, he said. “One of them was my own granddaughter,” he said. One of the smaller camps, Parwan-e-Se is home to 100 families, about 600 to 700 residents, he said.\nOn Wednesday, Ms. Amos, who is on a three-day visit to Afghanistan, toured that camp, largely mud huts in a former vacant lot, walking between open rivulets of sewage and pools of waste and garbage. “Clearly there’s a lot of work we need to do,” Ms. Amos said, acknowledging that the camps’ problems had been chronic and long-term. “The real issue is finding land and helping them to relocate.”\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Residents disagree and claim their home areas are still too unsafe, and many have asked the Afghan government for land and assistance to build homes here.\nRevelations about the deaths in the heart of Kabul, despite a 10-year, $60 billion humanitarian effort in Afghanistan, caused an outpouring of public reaction, both in Afghanistan and internationally.\nCamp residents have been caught in a conundrum of international and government policy. Since the Afghan government insists the camps should be disbanded, they do not generally qualify for development aid since they are temporary facilities. So programs that would provide safe housing, education or jobs are often unavailable.\nAt the same time, since the poor conditions in the camps are chronic and longstanding — most of the camps are more than five years old now — they do not qualify for many types of humanitarian aid earmarked for crises, which are by definition not chronic. In addition, the Afghan government is concerned that if camp conditions are improved too much, it will turn them into magnets for even more refugees.\nIn response to the concern generated over the deaths of children last winter, however, the United Nations and aid groups have banded together to prevent a recurrence if bad weather returns next year.\nThe results of the Solidarités survey were shared with the Kabul Informal Settlements Task Force, which includes United Nations agencies and aid groups, and donors have already earmarked funds to prevent a similar disaster from recurring next year, making sure there is sufficient fuel and other resources to protect the camp populations.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n“I think it will be better now, we will be better prepared,” Ms. Bara said. “It’s the least we can do.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/10/world/asia/winter-killed-at-least-100-afghan-refugee-children-study-estimates.html"}
