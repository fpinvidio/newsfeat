Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School who is an expert on white-collar crime. “Do they really mean what they said in that memo? Will they pursue individuals and not just the underlings?”\nWells Fargo’s $185 million settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies hardly puts an end to the matter.
