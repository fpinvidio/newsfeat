Recent comments by administration officials suggested that they did not particularly like the legislation but could not stop the growing wave of bipartisan support for it.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/health-law-revision-is-approved.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
