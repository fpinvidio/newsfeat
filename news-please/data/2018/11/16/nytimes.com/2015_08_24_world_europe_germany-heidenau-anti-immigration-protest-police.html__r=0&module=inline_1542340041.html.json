Almost 83,000 refugees arrived in Germany last month, and the government estimates that by the end of the year, 800,000 people will have come seeking asylum.\nThe Dresden police said that about 250 people, some holding bottles and waving flags associated with right-wing groups, demonstrated late Saturday and early Sunday near a former building supply outlet in Heidenau, a town of about 16,000 people on the Elbe River south of Dresden. The building, which resembles a warehouse, is being used as temporary housing for about 600 asylum seekers, with more arriving daily.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/24/world/europe/germany-heidenau-anti-immigration-protest-police.html?_r=0&module=inline"}
