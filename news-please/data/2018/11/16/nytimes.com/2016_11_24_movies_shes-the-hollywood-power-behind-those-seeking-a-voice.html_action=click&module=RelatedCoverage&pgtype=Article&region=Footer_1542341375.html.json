What’s the plan for there to be more women here? I think that’s a fair question.”\nImage The ballerina Misty Copeland, who has Ms. Shaw to thank, in part, for the Misty Copeland Barbie doll.

Bunche Center for African American Studies at U.C.L.A. A flip through many of the entertainment industry’s lists of power lawyers yields approximately the same results.\nBert Fields, the longtime Hollywood lawyer, applauded an emphasis on diversity in hiring: “Sure as hell, there’s more to be done,” he said. But, he added: “When it comes to selecting who I want to be my lawyer, I want the best lawyer for the price. I don’t want to think about diversity in selecting who’s going to represent me at a trial, or negotiate my contract.”\nMs. Shaw saw an obligation to do things differently. In her over 35 years as an entertainment lawyer, she was often the only woman or person of color in a meeting; like many of her contemporaries, she has stories of male colleagues who asked her to fetch coffee or hang coats. Early on, she said, “I actually felt things were going to change. I thought there would be lots of women in law firms and lots of women in agencies. And I’ve come to realize that that’s not the case, and if it’s going to happen, I’m going to have to be a big part of the change.”\nNow, as one of the few women of color leading the legal side of show business, Ms. Shaw has become a beacon. A founding partner at the firm Del Shaw Moonves Tanaka Finkelstein & Lezcano — where about half the lawyers are women — her roster of clients includes Ms. Nyong’o, James Earl Jones, Laurence Fishburne, John Legend and the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates. Projects with a social justice mission, which don’t necessarily produce as many billable hours, stir her. “I want to have been part of the work in this industry that makes society better,” she said. “I want to have left some kind of legacy here.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/24/movies/shes-the-hollywood-power-behind-those-seeking-a-voice.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
