Political scientists say this has resulted in a phenomenon where people vote against the opposing party rather than for their own candidate.\n“We are in a position where both parties have extremely negative views of the opposite party and that pulls down the candidates’ favorables,” said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School poll. “The good news for both of them is they have to run against each other. So, in that sense, neither is substantially disadvantaged.”\nWithin the Parties, Cautious Optimism\n+60 Hillary Clinton Net favorability by candidate’s party +30 Becomes presumptive nominee Donald J.

Mr. Sanders’s insistence on remaining in the race through the convention could temper Mrs. Clinton’s potential convention bounce, the lift she would get once the party’s convention ends.\nBill Clinton was the master of the convention bounce in 1992; Al Gore got a lift in 2000.\nThe 2008 Republican convention gave John McCain a notable increase, but it did not last. The Democratic convention that year unified Democrats behind Barack Obama after a bruising primary battle with Mrs. Clinton.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/03/us/elections/trump-and-clinton-favorability.html"}
