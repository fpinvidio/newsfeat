George Balanchine, who found both to be appropriate music for ballet, might have answered, “They both got rhythm.” Or at least that correspondence was apparent at the David H. Koch Theater on Tuesday, when his “Concerto Barocco” (1941) and “Who Cares?” (1970) opened and closed a program of New York City Ballet.\nFrom the first strains of Bach in “Concerto Barocco,” and throughout, the corps of eight women attacked the steps with enlivening snap, pouncing on Bach’s and Balanchine’s rhythms and making the clean, contrapuntal patterns crackle. Sara Mearns, as one of the two lead women who personify the score’s two violins, was even more exact. Only her counterpart, Maria Kowroski, showed any hesitation.\nIn the second movement adagio, Ms. Kowroski was at home, her long legs reaching in singing lines. She had an attentive partner in Justin Peck, who, as the music picked up, seemed to lift and lower her into a more acute relationship to the rhythm. By the third moment, her imitative exchanges with Ms. Mearns were tighter.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/arts/dance/new-york-city-ballet-in-a-broad-program-at-the-koch-theater.html?_r=0&module=inline"}
