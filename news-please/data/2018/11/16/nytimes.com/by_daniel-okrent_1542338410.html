                    13 Things I Meant to Write About but Never Did                </h2>
                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">AND so all good (and tense and terrible and exciting) things must come to an end. When I began in this job in December 2003, I had a list of about 20 topics I knew I wanted to address. In the ensuing months, I got to about half of those, and devoted the rest of my time and space to issues that exploded out of the pages of the paper and my e-mail in-box. The 10 I never got to are now hanging in a closet with about 50 others. What follows, you will soon see, is an all but random selection. 1. In my very first column I identified myself as ''an absolutist'' on the First Amendment. Apart from having come to realize that absolutism in the pursuit of self-definition can be a bit reckless, my thoughts on journalism and the First Amendment have changed considerably. I still cherish the First; I still think it's the cornerstone of democracy. But I would love to see journalists justify their work not by wrapping themselves in the cloak of the law, but by invoking more persuasive defenses: accuracy, for instance, and fairness.</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">SOMETIME in the next few days The Times's staff will be presented a statement titled ''Preserving Our Readers' Trust.'' Prepared by a committee of reporters and editors led by assistant managing editor Allan M. Siegal, the document will offer recommendations addressing such subjects as sourcing, bias, the division between news and opinion, and communication with readers. Staff members will be invited to comment, and then executive editor Bill Keller will determine which recommendations to adopt, adapt or dismiss. I haven't seen the recommendations, but I suspect that those having to do with anonymous sources will be the most controversial among the reporting staff. Reporters who work the corridors of criminal justice, the foreign policy world and the intelligence community cannot do their jobs without unidentified sources. Many who cover those twin cesspools of duplicity, self-regard and back-stabbing -- Hollywood and politics -- are addicted to the practice. And implicit in much of the criticism aimed at any journalist who uses a blind quote is the unpleasant suggestion of dishonorable behavior.</p>

                    The Hottest Button: How The Times Covers Israel and Palestine                </h2>
                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">Let me offer two statements about this paper's coverage of the conflict in the Middle East. First: I find the correspondents at The Times to be honest and committed journalists. Second: The Times today is the gold standard as far as setting out in precise language the perspectives of the parties, the contents of resolutions, the terms of international conventions. Neither of these comments is my own. The first is a direct quotation from Michael F. Brown, executive director of Partners for Peace, an organization that seeks, it says, ''to end the occupation of the Palestinian territories.'' The second comes from Andrea Levin, president and executive director of the Committee for Accurate Middle East Reporting in America, the muscular pro-Zionist media monitor. With partisans on each side offering respectful appraisal in place of vituperation and threat, you would think that we had reached a milestone moment in The Times's coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">ONE of the more persistent criticisms of The Times comes from those who believe the news pages are the designated disseminator of views passed down from the Olympus that is the editorial page. If there's anyone among the 1,200 newsroom employees of The Times who believes this to be true, I've failed as a reporter: in 16 months, I haven't found a soul here who has ever experienced any pressure, or even endured a suggestion, to conform to the opinions expressed on the editorial page. Hold your hoots. There may be perfectly sensible reasons why some readers believe that the news pages take direction from the editorial page, some of which I've discussed before, particularly the apparently normative, basically liberal worldview of much of the news staff on various social issues and the generally oppositional position toward those in power that typifies modern journalists. There's also the sheer forcefulness of the editorial page's voice, which in recent years has been so assertively left, and which some people unfamiliar with The Times's operations want to believe is the source of the news staff's daily marching orders.</p>

                    The War of the Words: A Dispatch From the Front Lines                </h2>
                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">NOTHING provokes as much rage as what many perceive to be The Times's policy on the use of ''terrorist,'' ''terrorism'' and ''terror.'' There is no policy, actually, but except in the context of Al Qaeda, or in direct quotations, these words, as explosive as what they describe, show up very rarely. Among pro-Israeli readers (and nonreaders urged to write to me by media watchdog organizations), the controversy over variants of the T-word has become the stand-in for the Israel-Palestine conflict itself. When Israel's targeted assassinations of suspected sponsors of terrorism provoke retaliation, some pro-Palestinian readers argue that any armed response against civilians by such groups as Hamas is morally equivalent. Critics on the other side say The Times's general avoidance of the word ''terrorism'' is a political decision, and exactly what Hamas wants.</p>

I had opened the column with a brief discussion of a story carrying the bylines of Torok and reporter Jacques Steinberg, and then leapt into a discussion of the misuse of numbers elsewhere in the paper. Torok believed, as he said in an e-mail message, that I used their piece ''as the lead example of number fumbling,'' and that he and Steinberg had been ''harmed'' by it.</p>

                    Talking on the Air and Out of Turn: The Trouble With TV                </h2>
                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">LAST Sunday, Times reporter Judith Miller appeared on MSNBC's ''Hardball With Chris Matthews'' to discuss the Iraqi elections. In the course of the conversation Miller said sources had told her the Bush administration ''has been reaching out'' to the Iraqi political figure Ahmad Chalabi ''to offer him expressions of cooperation.'' She continued, ''According to one report, he was even offered a chance to be an interior minister in the new government.'' This led Matthews to interrupt Miller, exclaim ''Wait a minute!'' and press her to elaborate. Now, Matthews is the sort of television host who will interrupt a guest about as often as he blinks, and his reliance on exclamation is roughly equal to his reliance on breathing. But to anyone who has tried to follow the jagged contours of Ahmed Chalabi's connections to the Bush administration, Miller's statement was a shocker. This piece of news hadn't appeared in The Times that morning; it didn't appear in The Times the next morning; as I write this column, on Friday, it still hasn't appeared. A lengthy analysis of the election aftermath by reporter Dexter Filkins, published Tuesday, didn't even hint of any current contact between Chalabi and the Bush administration.</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">Some people in the newspaper business -- including, I suspect, a few sitting upstairs from me, in the New York Times Company's corporate offices -- were displeased by a story that ran on Jan. 10, ''Your Daily Paper, Courtesy of a Sponsor.'' The article, by Jacques Steinberg and Tom Torok, was a pretty sharp pin stuck into the circulation numbers of many American newspapers, revealing how subscriptions paid for by advertisers are delivered to readers who haven't asked for them. I fielded a couple of days' worth of objections from the newspaper industry, and while I concluded that the piece was largely fair and entirely accurate (if somewhat overstated), I do think it could have been more candid about The Times's own practices. Readers who wanted to know how The Times fitted into this story didn't find out until (more likely, ''unless'') they made it to the 30th paragraph; the practices at The Boston Globe, owned by The New York Times Company, were unveiled in Paragraph 27. Even then the article was slightly less than forthcoming. By studying circulation patterns of Sunday papers, the article made The Times appear less reliant on these advertiser-subsidized subscriptions than it would have if the comparisons had been based on weekday circulation.</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">TWO Mondays ago, the scale of the Indian Ocean catastrophe was just emerging from the incomplete earlier reports (from a Times article the day before: a tidal wave had ''killed more than 150 people in Sri Lanka''). By the 4:30 Page 1 meeting, picture editors had examined more than 900 images of devastation to find the one that would stretch across five columns and nearly half the depth of Tuesday's front page. Into a million homes came a grieving mother crouched beside the lifeless bodies of tiny children, and perhaps more horrifying, three pairs of feet extending from beneath a white sheet in an upper corner, suggesting the presence beyond the frame of row upon awful row of the tsunami's pitiless toll. Many readers and at least a few members of The Times's newsroom staff considered the picture exploitative, unduly graphic, and by its size and placement, inappropriately forced upon the paper's readers. Some felt it disrespectful of both the living and the dead. A few said The Times would not have published it had the children been white Americans. Boaz Rabin of Weehawken, N.J., wrote, ''Lead with letters the size of eggs, use any words you see fit, but don't put a nightmare on the front page.''</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">I really hadn't planned on doing this. Several weeks ago I decided that I'd write a year-end column enumerating a bunch of The Times's crimes and misdemeanors over the past 12 months -- the ones I never got around to writing about because they seemed of insufficient interest to support an entire column, or because they were replays of transgressions I had already addressed. Or because articles I'd clipped, notated and misplaced months ago suddenly showed up in my sock drawer. Then I read ''Changing Senate Looks Much Better to Abortion Foes,'' by Robin Toner (Dec. 2). This led me to decide that providing a catalog of sins would be churlish, not to mention unseasonable -- and that a very different sort of column would not only be seasonable, but what I wanted to write.</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">Two weeks ago, my column on The Times's arts listings brought gratitude from those who agreed with me and anger and derision, leavened with a few reasonable points of argument, from those who did not. I wouldn't expect it any other way. But among those who pounced on me here at the paper were some who were provoked by my use of ''glib,'' ''arrogance'' and ''condescending'' to portray the attitude of the culture editors. Those who took me to task included some Times editors and writers who agreed with my position on the listings changes, but found my choice of words indelicate. They may be right. If I were a better writer I would have followed the ancient dictum ''show, don't tell'' -- let readers come to their own conclusions instead of leading them with my own loaded characterizations. (While I'm in garment-rending mode, I want to correct a mistaken impression I may have left: when I wrote that ''at least two full Sunday pages are ready to be conscripted for the cause'' of revised listings, that was and is my opinion, and not the position of the editors.)</p>

On the cover it said ''Save the Listings: Restore the 'Arts & Leisure Guide' to the Sunday New York Times.'' Inside, 615 pages carried 5,000 Internet-gathered signatures, many of them accompanied by bits of testimony variously beseeching, enraged or tearful. Just a few weeks earlier, The Times had tossed the venerable columns of agate type that had filled so many pages of the Arts & Leisure section for so long, with as many as 300 cultural events acknowledged, however briefly, in a single edition. In what seemed to be their place, a single page featured slightly more than 20 cultural items, tucked in and around some less than enlightening photographs, under headlines so opaque as to be incomprehensible. Down the side of the page, in very large type, marched the days of the week. The items aligned next to each described a few events or productions scheduled for those particular days, but in several cases they were events that could also be enjoyed (or endured) on many other days. To many readers, this was not just confusing; it was replacing a symphony with a jingle.</p>

Surprisingly, I didn't hear from any experts determined to defend their positions in the address books of Times reporters. Maybe that's because some of them have established impregnable beachheads: Prof. Stephen Gillers of N.Y.U. has made 24 appearances in The Times so far this year (five under his own name, the rest in pieces by Times writers); Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein and Company has shown up 28 times; and the inevitable Gene Russianoff has appeared fully 46 times, in pieces by 23 different writers. Russianoff is a ''staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit advocacy group,'' a label The Times has slapped on him the way Homer glued ''gray-eyed goddess'' to Athena.</p>

On Tuesday alone, such seers and sages were rolled out 33 times. In a few cases they even added useful wisdom or perspective. In many others, though, their presence may have achieved the opposite of what the writers intended: they made readers wonder whether they were being conned. I'm not talking about the partisan political operatives whose apparent license to spin, sneer and smear devalues so much political reporting. I'm concerned with those experts rolled out to explain or contextualize complex matters (as reporters who use them would argue) or to confirm what the reporter already thinks (as far too many readers believe). There are a lot of issues that connect to this subject -- including the Godzilla of journalism issues, objectivity. But today I'll stick to two: establishing the credibility of named experts, and obliterating the very presence of the unnamed kind.</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">FEW things irritate (or amuse) readers of The Times more than the corrections that appear daily on Page A2. The runic syntax, the elliptic references, the straight-faced earnestness of a prose style that has acquired the gloss of self-parody -- they may offer their own eccentric delights, but they don't necessarily give readers, or bruised story subjects, what they want. To the editors, the corrections reflect the paper's determination to convince its readers that it takes accuracy seriously. To critics, though, they establish the opposite: a smokescreen of trivia intended to obscure serious transgressions that the paper chooses to ignore.</p>

                    13 Things I Meant to Write About but Never Did                </h2>
                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">AND so all good (and tense and terrible and exciting) things must come to an end. When I began in this job in December 2003, I had a list of about 20 topics I knew I wanted to address. In the ensuing months, I got to about half of those, and devoted the rest of my time and space to issues that exploded out of the pages of the paper and my e-mail in-box. The 10 I never got to are now hanging in a closet with about 50 others. What follows, you will soon see, is an all but random selection. 1. In my very first column I identified myself as ''an absolutist'' on the First Amendment. Apart from having come to realize that absolutism in the pursuit of self-definition can be a bit reckless, my thoughts on journalism and the First Amendment have changed considerably. I still cherish the First; I still think it's the cornerstone of democracy. But I would love to see journalists justify their work not by wrapping themselves in the cloak of the law, but by invoking more persuasive defenses: accuracy, for instance, and fairness.</p>

Prepared by a committee of reporters and editors led by assistant managing editor Allan M. Siegal, the document will offer recommendations addressing such subjects as sourcing, bias, the division between news and opinion, and communication with readers. Staff members will be invited to comment, and then executive editor Bill Keller will determine which recommendations to adopt, adapt or dismiss. I haven't seen the recommendations, but I suspect that those having to do with anonymous sources will be the most controversial among the reporting staff. Reporters who work the corridors of criminal justice, the foreign policy world and the intelligence community cannot do their jobs without unidentified sources. Many who cover those twin cesspools of duplicity, self-regard and back-stabbing -- Hollywood and politics -- are addicted to the practice. And implicit in much of the criticism aimed at any journalist who uses a blind quote is the unpleasant suggestion of dishonorable behavior.</p>

First: I find the correspondents at The Times to be honest and committed journalists. Second: The Times today is the gold standard as far as setting out in precise language the perspectives of the parties, the contents of resolutions, the terms of international conventions. Neither of these comments is my own. The first is a direct quotation from Michael F. Brown, executive director of Partners for Peace, an organization that seeks, it says, ''to end the occupation of the Palestinian territories.'' The second comes from Andrea Levin, president and executive director of the Committee for Accurate Middle East Reporting in America, the muscular pro-Zionist media monitor. With partisans on each side offering respectful appraisal in place of vituperation and threat, you would think that we had reached a milestone moment in The Times's coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">ONE of the more persistent criticisms of The Times comes from those who believe the news pages are the designated disseminator of views passed down from the Olympus that is the editorial page. If there's anyone among the 1,200 newsroom employees of The Times who believes this to be true, I've failed as a reporter: in 16 months, I haven't found a soul here who has ever experienced any pressure, or even endured a suggestion, to conform to the opinions expressed on the editorial page. Hold your hoots. There may be perfectly sensible reasons why some readers believe that the news pages take direction from the editorial page, some of which I've discussed before, particularly the apparently normative, basically liberal worldview of much of the news staff on various social issues and the generally oppositional position toward those in power that typifies modern journalists. There's also the sheer forcefulness of the editorial page's voice, which in recent years has been so assertively left, and which some people unfamiliar with The Times's operations want to believe is the source of the news staff's daily marching orders.</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">NOTHING provokes as much rage as what many perceive to be The Times's policy on the use of ''terrorist,'' ''terrorism'' and ''terror.'' There is no policy, actually, but except in the context of Al Qaeda, or in direct quotations, these words, as explosive as what they describe, show up very rarely. Among pro-Israeli readers (and nonreaders urged to write to me by media watchdog organizations), the controversy over variants of the T-word has become the stand-in for the Israel-Palestine conflict itself. When Israel's targeted assassinations of suspected sponsors of terrorism provoke retaliation, some pro-Palestinian readers argue that any armed response against civilians by such groups as Hamas is morally equivalent. Critics on the other side say The Times's general avoidance of the word ''terrorism'' is a political decision, and exactly what Hamas wants.</p>

I had opened the column with a brief discussion of a story carrying the bylines of Torok and reporter Jacques Steinberg, and then leapt into a discussion of the misuse of numbers elsewhere in the paper. Torok believed, as he said in an e-mail message, that I used their piece ''as the lead example of number fumbling,'' and that he and Steinberg had been ''harmed'' by it.</p>

                    Talking on the Air and Out of Turn: The Trouble With TV                </h2>
                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">LAST Sunday, Times reporter Judith Miller appeared on MSNBC's ''Hardball With Chris Matthews'' to discuss the Iraqi elections. In the course of the conversation Miller said sources had told her the Bush administration ''has been reaching out'' to the Iraqi political figure Ahmad Chalabi ''to offer him expressions of cooperation.'' She continued, ''According to one report, he was even offered a chance to be an interior minister in the new government.'' This led Matthews to interrupt Miller, exclaim ''Wait a minute!'' and press her to elaborate. Now, Matthews is the sort of television host who will interrupt a guest about as often as he blinks, and his reliance on exclamation is roughly equal to his reliance on breathing. But to anyone who has tried to follow the jagged contours of Ahmed Chalabi's connections to the Bush administration, Miller's statement was a shocker. This piece of news hadn't appeared in The Times that morning; it didn't appear in The Times the next morning; as I write this column, on Friday, it still hasn't appeared. A lengthy analysis of the election aftermath by reporter Dexter Filkins, published Tuesday, didn't even hint of any current contact between Chalabi and the Bush administration.</p>

                    Numbed by the Numbers, When They Just Don't Add Up                </h2>
                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">Some people in the newspaper business -- including, I suspect, a few sitting upstairs from me, in the New York Times Company's corporate offices -- were displeased by a story that ran on Jan. 10, ''Your Daily Paper, Courtesy of a Sponsor.'' The article, by Jacques Steinberg and Tom Torok, was a pretty sharp pin stuck into the circulation numbers of many American newspapers, revealing how subscriptions paid for by advertisers are delivered to readers who haven't asked for them. I fielded a couple of days' worth of objections from the newspaper industry, and while I concluded that the piece was largely fair and entirely accurate (if somewhat overstated), I do think it could have been more candid about The Times's own practices. Readers who wanted to know how The Times fitted into this story didn't find out until (more likely, ''unless'') they made it to the 30th paragraph; the practices at The Boston Globe, owned by The New York Times Company, were unveiled in Paragraph 27. Even then the article was slightly less than forthcoming. By studying circulation patterns of Sunday papers, the article made The Times appear less reliant on these advertiser-subsidized subscriptions than it would have if the comparisons had been based on weekday circulation.</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">TWO Mondays ago, the scale of the Indian Ocean catastrophe was just emerging from the incomplete earlier reports (from a Times article the day before: a tidal wave had ''killed more than 150 people in Sri Lanka''). By the 4:30 Page 1 meeting, picture editors had examined more than 900 images of devastation to find the one that would stretch across five columns and nearly half the depth of Tuesday's front page. Into a million homes came a grieving mother crouched beside the lifeless bodies of tiny children, and perhaps more horrifying, three pairs of feet extending from beneath a white sheet in an upper corner, suggesting the presence beyond the frame of row upon awful row of the tsunami's pitiless toll. Many readers and at least a few members of The Times's newsroom staff considered the picture exploitative, unduly graphic, and by its size and placement, inappropriately forced upon the paper's readers. Some felt it disrespectful of both the living and the dead. A few said The Times would not have published it had the children been white Americans. Boaz Rabin of Weehawken, N.J., wrote, ''Lead with letters the size of eggs, use any words you see fit, but don't put a nightmare on the front page.''</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">I really hadn't planned on doing this. Several weeks ago I decided that I'd write a year-end column enumerating a bunch of The Times's crimes and misdemeanors over the past 12 months -- the ones I never got around to writing about because they seemed of insufficient interest to support an entire column, or because they were replays of transgressions I had already addressed. Or because articles I'd clipped, notated and misplaced months ago suddenly showed up in my sock drawer. Then I read ''Changing Senate Looks Much Better to Abortion Foes,'' by Robin Toner (Dec. 2). This led me to decide that providing a catalog of sins would be churlish, not to mention unseasonable -- and that a very different sort of column would not only be seasonable, but what I wanted to write.</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">Two weeks ago, my column on The Times's arts listings brought gratitude from those who agreed with me and anger and derision, leavened with a few reasonable points of argument, from those who did not. I wouldn't expect it any other way. But among those who pounced on me here at the paper were some who were provoked by my use of ''glib,'' ''arrogance'' and ''condescending'' to portray the attitude of the culture editors. Those who took me to task included some Times editors and writers who agreed with my position on the listings changes, but found my choice of words indelicate. They may be right. If I were a better writer I would have followed the ancient dictum ''show, don't tell'' -- let readers come to their own conclusions instead of leading them with my own loaded characterizations. (While I'm in garment-rending mode, I want to correct a mistaken impression I may have left: when I wrote that ''at least two full Sunday pages are ready to be conscripted for the cause'' of revised listings, that was and is my opinion, and not the position of the editors.)</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">IT landed on my desk a few weeks ago with an echoing thump that could have awakened Brooks Atkinson. On the cover it said ''Save the Listings: Restore the 'Arts & Leisure Guide' to the Sunday New York Times.'' Inside, 615 pages carried 5,000 Internet-gathered signatures, many of them accompanied by bits of testimony variously beseeching, enraged or tearful. Just a few weeks earlier, The Times had tossed the venerable columns of agate type that had filled so many pages of the Arts & Leisure section for so long, with as many as 300 cultural events acknowledged, however briefly, in a single edition. In what seemed to be their place, a single page featured slightly more than 20 cultural items, tucked in and around some less than enlightening photographs, under headlines so opaque as to be incomprehensible. Down the side of the page, in very large type, marched the days of the week. The items aligned next to each described a few events or productions scheduled for those particular days, but in several cases they were events that could also be enjoyed (or endured) on many other days. To many readers, this was not just confusing; it was replacing a symphony with a jingle.</p>

Surprisingly, I didn't hear from any experts determined to defend their positions in the address books of Times reporters. Maybe that's because some of them have established impregnable beachheads: Prof. Stephen Gillers of N.Y.U. has made 24 appearances in The Times so far this year (five under his own name, the rest in pieces by Times writers); Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein and Company has shown up 28 times; and the inevitable Gene Russianoff has appeared fully 46 times, in pieces by 23 different writers. Russianoff is a ''staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit advocacy group,'' a label The Times has slapped on him the way Homer glued ''gray-eyed goddess'' to Athena.</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">ANY reader of this newspaper knows how The Times likes to invoke the wisdom of people identified as ''experts'' or ''analysts,'' but until I counted their presence the other day I had no idea how crowded with expertise the paper was. On Tuesday alone, such seers and sages were rolled out 33 times. In a few cases they even added useful wisdom or perspective. In many others, though, their presence may have achieved the opposite of what the writers intended: they made readers wonder whether they were being conned. I'm not talking about the partisan political operatives whose apparent license to spin, sneer and smear devalues so much political reporting. I'm concerned with those experts rolled out to explain or contextualize complex matters (as reporters who use them would argue) or to confirm what the reporter already thinks (as far too many readers believe). There are a lot of issues that connect to this subject -- including the Godzilla of journalism issues, objectivity. But today I'll stick to two: establishing the credibility of named experts, and obliterating the very presence of the unnamed kind.</p>

To the editors, the corrections reflect the paper's determination to convince its readers that it takes accuracy seriously. To critics, though, they establish the opposite: a smokescreen of trivia intended to obscure serious transgressions that the paper chooses to ignore.</p>
