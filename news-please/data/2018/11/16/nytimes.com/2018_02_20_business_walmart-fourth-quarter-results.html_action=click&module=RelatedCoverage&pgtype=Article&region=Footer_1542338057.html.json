Analysts have nonetheless questioned how Walmart plans to integrate the acquisitions into a cohesive online retail strategy.\nOn Tuesday, the company said it would focus its broad push for new customers on Walmart.com and not Jet, a less-recognizable brand tailored to more urban, higher-income customers.\nWalmart spent $3.3 billion to acquire Jet in 2016. At the time, it was the largest deal ever for an e-commerce company, although it was not clear how the two brands would mesh. “Jet will go through adjustment, but it will grow again,” Mr. McMillon said on Tuesday.\nWalmart’s lagging growth online was not entirely unexpected given that the Jet acquisition was responsible for the large growth rates of previous quarters. But Mr. McMillon acknowledged that the fourth-quarter slowdown “was a bit more than we planned.”\nTo increase growth again — Walmart said it expected online sales to rise 40 percent over the next year — the company is accelerating its web-based grocery business, increasing the number of stores where customers can order food online and pick it up in stores. Walmart is also experimenting with home delivery in the United States and in Asia, where it recently signed a partnership with the Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten to deliver groceries.\nStill, finding ways to integrate Walmart’s stores with its e-commerce strategy is costly. Last week, Walmart announced that it would offer members of its Sam’s Club unit free shipping of online orders for an annual fee of $100.\nAs part of that effort, Walmart said it would convert a Sam’s Club store in Memphis into an e-commerce distribution center and planned to open more such centers elsewhere in the United States in the coming year.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/business/walmart-fourth-quarter-results.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
