By registering and paying your deposit for a Tour, you are entering into this Participant Agreement with us. Please read these terms carefully before making a deposit or payment for a Tour. These terms may be supplemented by additional terms and conditions specific to your Tour (“Supplemental Terms”). In the event of a conflict between this agreement and the supplemental terms, the Supplemental Terms will apply.\nTimes Journeys Participant Agreement\nTimes Journeys, a part of The New York Times Company, acts only as the trip sponsor and is not responsible for the acts or omissions of other parties. The trip described on the Times Journeys website (the “Website”) or in your brochure (the “Tour”) is provided by an independent tour operator named on the Website or in your brochure (the “Operator”). Times Journeys and the Operator are collectively referred to as “we or “us”. The terms and conditions of this Participant Agreement apply to your Tour and the program for the Tour (the “Itinerary”).\nPricing and Inclusions: Quoted Tour prices are per person, double occupancy except where indicated. Prices include programming, planning, handling and operational charges and are based on current rates of exchange, tariffs and taxes in effect at the time of publication. We reserve the right to increase Tour prices to cover increased costs, tariffs, taxes and V.A.T. received after prices are published and to reflect fluctuations in foreign exchange markets. We will not give a breakdown in the price of a Tour or its parts. Modification of Tour content size will not affect the published price.\nExclusions: Quoted Tour prices exclude: trip insurance; airfares between points on the Tour; international airfare, including airfare and other transportation to and from the Tour (unless otherwise noted); costs associated with obtaining passports or entry visas; airport departure taxes (unless otherwise noted); excess baggage charges; gratuities to the Tour directors, drivers and guides; meals other than those specified in the Itinerary; sightseeing not included in the Itinerary; and personal expenses such as laundry, communication charges and optional activities (which are subject to availability).\nReservations and Payments: The Tour deposit amount is listed on the Website or in your brochure. The deposit is required in order to confirm your booking. Upon receipt of the deposit, the Operator will send you confirmation of your booking. Your final payment date will be listed on the confirmation. If a Tour is already full, we will accept deposits on a standby basis. If space becomes available, you will have the choice of joining the Tour by paying in full or forfeiting the space in return for a refund of your deposit. Final payment is due ninety (90) days prior to departure unless otherwise indicated on the Website or in the brochure. If your reservation is made within ninety (90) days of departure, the entire cost of the trip must be paid at the time of the request in order to secure confirmation.\nTravel Insurance: We strongly recommend that you purchase trip cancellation and medical insurance. The Operator will provide the insurance applications along with your booking confirmation. Any questions about what travel insurance does or does not cover should be addressed directly to the travel insurance company. If you decline insurance coverage, you will personally assume full responsibility for any financial loss associated with your travel arrangements, and you could lose your travel investment and/or have to pay more money to correct the situation.\nSingle Travelers: Tour prices are based on double occupancy. Single travelers will be expected to pay the single supplement fee.\nCancellation by You: We must receive your cancellation notice in writing by email, fax or overnight courier, and your cancellation date will be the date on which we receive your notice.\nDeposit is 100% non-refundable at time of booking.\nIf we receive your cancellation notice ninety (90) to sixty-one (61) days prior to the departure date, we will retain fifty percent (50%) of the Tour price based on double occupancy, excluding optional payments.\nIf we receive your cancellation notice sixty (60) days or fewer prior to the departure date, we will retain one hundred percent (100%) of the Tour price.\nAny penalty imposed by an airline, including for airline service between points on the Tour (“Internal Air”) or travel to or from the Tour, is your responsibility.\nYour decision not to participate on the Tour due to State Department warnings, fear of travel, illness or any other reason will be deemed a cancellation. If a flight or other delay for any reason prevents you from joining the Tour on the Tour departure date and time, you will be considered a no-show, and we cannot provide a full or partial refund or credit toward a future Tour, but you may join the Tour late if you wish.\nAir Transportation during the Tour: Internal Air is not included in the price of the Tour. Estimated Internal Air costs will be identified separately on the Website or in your brochure. Internal Air costs and availability are subject to change at any time prior to final payment for your Tour and we reserve the right to increase Tour prices accordingly. We will not change your seat assignment request on commercial aircraft without your permission. However, airlines often change seat assignments to satisfy their loyalty members or because of equipment changes (aircraft type). We are not notified of these changes in advance, and often travelers are not made aware of these changes until they arrive at the airport. We cannot be responsible for seat assignment changes made by the airline. Frequent flier programs are private agreements between airlines and passengers, and we cannot be held responsible for mileage discrepancies involving airline loyalty reward programs.\nPassports and Visas: You are solely responsible for complying with passport and visa requirements. For U.S. travelers, international travel requires a passport valid six (6) months beyond your intended return travel date. In many cases, you will also need to have multiple consecutive blank visa pages within your passport (the number varies depending on the destination(s)). Many destinations also require that visas be obtained prior to travel. It is recommended that you check with the U.S. Department of State website for the latest passport and visa requirements.\nCancellation or Substitution by Us: We will make commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Itinerary as it has been published; however, the final Itinerary may vary due to availability and factors beyond our control. We may in our sole discretion substitute services such as hotels or goods of similar quality for any service or good stated in the Itinerary. If a Times Journeys speaker (“Speaker”) cancels, the Operator will make every effort to find a replacement. You will not be refunded in whole or in part when the Operator is unable to find a replacement Speaker.\nWe reserve the right to cancel any Tour because of inadequate enrollment that makes the trip economically infeasible to operate or because of our concerns with respect to the safety, health or welfare of our travelers or staff. If we cancel a Tour, our liability is limited to a full refund of your payments to us and we will not be liable for any other costs, damages or refunds of any kind for any loss, delay, inconvenience, disappointment or expense whatsoever in such circumstances. If a Tour in progress must be interrupted or canceled, our liability shall be strictly limited to refund of the recoverable cost of any unused portion of the Tour.\nOther Taxes and Fees: Some governments charge departure taxes and/or fees. These fees are the responsibility of each passenger traveling to the designated country and are not included in the Tour price unless stated.\nBaggage: We assume no liability for loss or damage to baggage in transit to and from a Tour or while on a Tour. We recommend purchasing a supplemental travel insurance package.\nChildren: Unless otherwise indicated in the Tour description, all Tour passengers must be at least ten (10) years of age. However, some activities contained within an Itinerary may have a different age restriction than the overall minimum age requirement, in which case details will be provided at the time of booking. We reserve the right to marginally exceed the published maximum group size on family Tours to accommodate a family.\nSuppliers Acts or Omissions: The Operator acts only as an independent contractor to supply or arrange for the travel services named in your Itinerary or otherwise to procure services or goods from third parties such as airlines, hotels and other lodging providers, local hosts, guides, bus lines, car rental companies, driving services, restaurants and providers of entertainment (the “Suppliers”).
