In time, she and her beloved brother, Daniel, move to the city, where Virginia falls in with an artistic crowd but remains deeply solitary, most comfortable in the company of her own meandering thoughts. To be published by New Directions on March 27.\nAbout the artist: Sam McKinniss studied at N.Y.U. and is based in New York. His paintings, which focus on figuration, draw from popular culture and explore themes of romance, tragedy and celebrity. He is represented by Team Gallery, whose Venice Beach, L.A., location showed a solo exhibition of his work, ‘‘Daisy Chain,’’ earlier this year. This month, McKinniss’s work can be seen in the group exhibition ‘‘The Lure of the Dark: Contemporary Painters Conjure the Night’’ at MASS MoCA in North Adams, Mass., and at Art Basel Hong Kong.\nPhotographs of illustrations: Joshua Scott", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/t-magazine/hieu-minh-nguyen-alan-hollinghurst-new-books.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article"}
