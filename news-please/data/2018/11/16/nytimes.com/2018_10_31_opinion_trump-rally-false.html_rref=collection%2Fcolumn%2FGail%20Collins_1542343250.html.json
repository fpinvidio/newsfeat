(“We’re getting prepared for the caravan folks, you don’t have to worry about that.”)\nHe’s now adding a plug for his new plan to toss out the part of the Constitution that says if you’re born here, you’re a citizen — an idea that has even Paul Ryan reeling. (“People didn’t want to bring it up. I said we have to bring it up.”)\nWe know now that both the alleged pipe bomb-maker and the synagogue shooting suspect were obsessed with immigrants. Immigrant-bashing is what Trump thinks is the key to winning the midterms. It’s also the place where Trump becomes an abettor in the right-wing, white nationalist turmoil that’s torturing the country.\nIt’s insane to expect him to lift up the nation. But is it too much to ask that he just avoid the violence-inducing themes in his repertoire?\nFor instance, he loves to remind his fans that he won the election, and that’s a safe topic. Maybe he could devote half an hour of every rally to his theory that it’s harder to win electoral votes than the popular vote. Plus crowd estimates — he could spend some time claiming that 47 percent of the entire population of Fort Wayne, Ind., was standing outside the door, in terrible weather, just to watch him on closed-circuit television.\nWe’re better off if he talks about the mysterious promise of a 10 percent tax cut known to no one in Washington but Donald Trump. And the Space Force! (“So important. That’s where it’s at.”)\nWhat else could he say that isn’t dangerous? Well — he could talk about the things the Republican majority did over the last two years. O.K., that definitely wouldn’t fill up an hour.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/opinion/trump-rally-false.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2FGail%20Collins"}
