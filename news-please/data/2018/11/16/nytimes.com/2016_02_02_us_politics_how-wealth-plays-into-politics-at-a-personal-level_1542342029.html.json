Trump suggests that it is precisely his wealth that liberates him from the influence of special interests.\nSo it is fair to ask whether a politician’s personal bankroll should be taken into account by voters as a predictor of how he or she might lead. A growing body of research has addressed the extent to which wealth, behavior and policy are linked.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/us/politics/how-wealth-plays-into-politics-at-a-personal-level.html"}
