She said doctors told her that she was the last bomb victim there to be released. Just after 4 a.m., she told the story of what happened to her.\nOn Saturday night, she was walking through the metal gate outside her apartment building on the south side of West 23rd Street, where she has lived for 11 years. She carried a bag with some bottles of wine inside.\nWithout warning, an explosion lifted her off her feet. The blast, which injured 29 people, appeared to be an intentional act, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said, though the authorities did not believe it was linked to international terrorism.\n“It was the biggest blast I ever would imagine; lights flashing, glass shattering,” Ms. Ayeh recalled. “It happened so fast I was thrown up and landed down. I didn’t know where it had come from.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/19/nyregion/chelsea-explosion-victim-thrown.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
