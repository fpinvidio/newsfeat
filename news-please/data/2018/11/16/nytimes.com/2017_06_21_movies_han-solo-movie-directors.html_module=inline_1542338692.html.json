The two directors, who met in college, have collaborated on “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs” and “The Lego Movie,” both of which they wrote and directed; and “21 Jump Street” and its sequel, “22 Jump Street,” which they directed.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/movies/han-solo-movie-directors.html?module=inline"}
