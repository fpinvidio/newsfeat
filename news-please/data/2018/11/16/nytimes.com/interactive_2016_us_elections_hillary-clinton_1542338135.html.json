In the general election, she will need to win over the so-called Obama coalition of blacks and young, college-educated white voters who supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. But she will also need to maintain her base of support among white working-class women while battling it out for college-educated women in the suburbs. White working-class men have drifted away from the Democratic Party, but Mrs. Clinton has appeal among those who still harbor warm feelings for Bill Clinton. Hispanics overwhelmingly supported Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Obama in the 2008 Democratic primaries, but overhauling the nationâ€™s immigration laws has become a more divisive issue since then, and some Hispanics wonder how committed Mrs. Clinton is to it. To win crucial states like Florida and Colorado, she will need to convince them that she is on their side.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/hillary-clinton.html"}
