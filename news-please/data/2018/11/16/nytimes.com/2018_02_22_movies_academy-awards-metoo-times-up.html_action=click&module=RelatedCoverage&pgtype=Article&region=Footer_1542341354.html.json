The Screen Actors Guild Awards, which had a female-only lineup of presenters, were focused on gender inequality and other social ills. At the Baftas, given by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, domestic violence activists, inspired by the Time’s Up campaign, swarmed the red carpet.\nBut in this #MeToo era the people behind the Oscar telecast have a message: Our show will be focused on films, not the cultural moment around them.\n“We want to make it as entertaining as possible — reverential and respectful but also fun and emotional,” said Jennifer Todd, one of the lead producers of the Academy Awards, which will be hosted for the second year in a row by Jimmy Kimmel. “The Oscars should be a spectacle. Fun and funny and great performances.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/movies/academy-awards-metoo-times-up.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
