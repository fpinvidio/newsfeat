I work alone on the morning shift, from 6:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. It’s not part of my job, but if I see someone struggling with a box or a suitcase, whether a co-worker or a guest, I’ll lend a hand. I also take care of the eight lovebirds — the parrots — in the lobby.\nHow did you start caring for the birds?\nI’ve always liked animals. I grew up in Jamaica, where my family raised donkeys and horses on our farm.\nMy wife and I emigrated to the United States 15 years ago, and when I started this job, I was immediately attracted to the birds. The four blue, green and yellow ones remind me of the Jamaican flag.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/business/the-lovebirds-are-part-of-the-job.html"}
