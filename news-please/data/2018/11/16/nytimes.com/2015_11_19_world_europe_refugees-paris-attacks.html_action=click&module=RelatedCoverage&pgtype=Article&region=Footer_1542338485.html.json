But his feeling of security in the country he wishes to make his home evaporated, he said, when he saw what happened in Paris.\n“When I heard about Paris, I was crying,” Mr. Aryubi said. “Why? This was happening in Afghanistan.”\nHe had not expected to have this worry about extremist violence once he reached the European Union, he said. “I want to be safe,” he said, “but if this happens here, where do I go? Right now, I think of my future and I’m scared.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/world/europe/refugees-paris-attacks.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
