Their star Stephen Curry missed the end of the season and the start of the playoffs with a knee injury.\nIn the East, the Cleveland Cavaliers increasingly looked like a one-man team, with LeBron James carrying them to victories. They could manage only the fourth seed, and squeaked by the Indiana Pacers in the opening round of the playoffs in seven games, despite being outscored by 40 points in total.\nBut after Tuesdayâ€™s games, a fourth straight Cavs-Warriors N.B.A. finals looked a lot more likely.\nThe Warriors took a two-games-to-none lead over the New Orleans Pelicans, and, most important, welcomed back Curry.\nCurry played for the first time since March 23, and it was as if he never left. He hit a 3-pointer 11 seconds after checking in, and went on to score 28 points in 27 minutes. The Warriors earned a 121-116 victory, outscoring the Pelicans by 26 points when Curry was in the game.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/sports/basketball/cleveland-cavaliers-golden-state-warriors-nba-playoffs.html"}
