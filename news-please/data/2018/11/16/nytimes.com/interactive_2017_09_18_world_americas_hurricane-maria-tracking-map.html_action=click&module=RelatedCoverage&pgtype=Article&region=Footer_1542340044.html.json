The storm ripped off parts of the roof, and it forced people to the second and third floors of the stadium. In nearby Cataño, the town’s mayor told a radio station that 80 percent of the zinc-roofed homes in the Juana Matos neighborhood were destroyed.\nAlong the Río de la Plata Five spillways of La Plata dam were opened in advance of the storm in an attempt to avoid overflow and flooding. Still, La Plata river swelled to more than 11 feet above flood stage near Toa Alta and Comerío on Wednesday morning, and flash flood warnings were issued in Naranjito, Dorado and Toa Baja, other municipalities near the river.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/18/world/americas/hurricane-maria-tracking-map.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
