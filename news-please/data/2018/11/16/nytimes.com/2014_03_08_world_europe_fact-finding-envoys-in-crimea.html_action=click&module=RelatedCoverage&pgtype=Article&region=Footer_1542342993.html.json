Word spread that she was in the city. Crowds gathered. She said she could not see if they were armed. Her team decided to cancel the rest of the meetings and return to Kiev.\nMs. Thors said she could have faced the predicament that confronted a senior United Nations diplomat, Robert H. Serry, earlier this week, when he was chased out of Crimea by unidentified gunmen.\n“There was a risk the same could happen, that our movement could be hindered by the crowds,” Ms. Thors said in a telephone interview from her Amsterdam office. “We took precautionary principles. We shortened our stay.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/world/europe/fact-finding-envoys-in-crimea.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
