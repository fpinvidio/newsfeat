People who want to get a sense for how you think about education and jobs and all sorts of other issues can get a really good sense for your thinking by reading “The Audacity of Hope,” or by reading your old speeches, where you basically lay out your learning curve. But there’s no chapter on finance in “The Audacity of Hope.” And so I wonder if you would be willing to describe a little bit of your learning curve about finance, and what you envision finance being in tomorrow’s economy: Does it need to be smaller?

There’s a way in which that reminds me of your grandparents, even though I know your grandfather wasn’t a factory worker. You talk about the fact that your grandmother outearned your grandfather.

What do you think the future of work looks like for men?</em></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="360" data-total-count="16706"><strong>THE PRESIDENT:</strong> I think it’s an interesting question, because as I said, you know, you go in to factories all across the Midwest and you talk to the men who work there — they’ve got extraordinary skill and extraordinary pride in what they make. And I think that for them, the loss of manufacturing is a loss of a way of life and not just a loss of income.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="484" data-total-count="17190">I think a healthy economy is going to have a broad mix of jobs, and there has to be a place for somebody with terrific mechanical aptitude who can perform highly skilled tasks with his hands, whether it’s in construction or manufacturing. And I don’t think that those jobs should vanish. I do think that they will constitute a smaller percentage of the overall economy. And so what we’re going to have to do is, with a younger generation, find new places for that kind of work.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="483" data-total-count="17673">The possibilities are there, though.

One of the biggest constraints that we’ve got in building a smart grid in addition to siting issues, which are sort of classic political jurisdictional battles, is actually we don’t have enough trained electricians to lay down those lines. Now, you can’t tell me that there aren’t a whole bunch of men and women out there who are interested in those jobs. But somehow we have not done a good job of matching up the training with the need out there. And that’s one of the things where government can help, help to guide and steer our education process in a way that meets future needs and not just the needs of the past.</p><figure id="media-1194839845020" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-1194839845020 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/05/03/magazine/03obama.1-650.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group">

But, no, I think that one of the things that we all agree to is that the touchstone for economic policy is, does it allow the average American to find good employment and see their incomes rise; that we can’t just look at things in the aggregate, we do want to grow the pie, but we want to make sure that prosperity is spread across the spectrum of regions and occupations and genders and races; and that economic policy should focus on growing the pie, but it also has to make sure that everybody has got opportunity in that system.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="357" data-total-count="24481">I also think that there’s very little disagreement that there are lessons to be learned from this crisis in terms of the importance of regulation in the financial markets. And I think that this notion that there is somehow resistance to that — to those lessons within my economic team — just isn’t borne out by the discussions that I have every day.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="188" data-total-count="24669">If anything, the only thing I notice, I think, that I do think is something of a carry-over from Bob Rubin — I see it in Larry, I see it in Tim — is a great appreciation of complexity.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="64" data-total-count="24733"><em>And a willingness to admit what you don’t know, in many cases.</em></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="519" data-total-count="25252"><strong>THE PRESIDENT:</strong> Yes, exactly. And so what that means is that, as we’re making economic policy, I think there is a certain humility about the consequences of the actions we take, intended and unintended, that may make some outside observers impatient. I mean, you’ll recall Geithner was just getting hammered for months. But he, I think, is very secure in saying we need to get these things right, and if we act too abruptly, we can end up doing more harm than good. Those are qualities that I think have been useful.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="25" data-total-count="25277"><strong>V.

But ultimately, he’s the guy with the medical degree.

And certainly that’s true when it comes to <classifier idsrc="nyt-classifier" class="Topic" type="Topic" value="arts,automobiles,books,business,college,dining,education,fashion,garden,giving,health,jobs,magazine,movies,multimedia,nyregion,obituaries,realestate,science,sports,style,technology,theater,travel,us,washington,weekinreview,world:::Recent and archival health news about Medicare.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicare/index.html"><alt-code idsrc="nyt-classifier" value="Medicare"></alt-code>Medicare</classifier> and <classifier idsrc="nyt-classifier" class="Topic" type="Topic" value="arts,automobiles,books,business,college,dining,education,fashion,garden,giving,health,jobs,magazine,movies,multimedia,nyregion,obituaries,realestate,science,sports,style,technology,theater,travel,us,washington,weekinreview,world:::Recent and archival health news about Medicaid.:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html"><alt-code idsrc="nyt-classifier" value="Medicaid"></alt-code>Medicaid</classifier>, where the taxpayers are footing the bill and we have an obligation to get those costs under control.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="94" data-total-count="27189"><em>And right now we’re footing the bill for a lot of things that don’t make people healthier.</em></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="641" data-total-count="27830"><strong>THE PRESIDENT:</strong> That don’t make people healthier. So when Peter Orszag and I talk about the importance of using comparative-effectiveness studies (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/magazine/03obama-footnotes-t.html" title="Go to footnotes">9</a>) as a way of reining in costs, that’s not an attempt to micromanage the doctor-patient relationship. It is an attempt to say to patients, you know what, we’ve looked at some objective studies out here, people who know about this stuff, concluding that the blue pill, which costs half as much as the red pill, is just as effective, and you might want to go ahead and get the blue one. And if a provider is pushing the red one on you, then you should at least ask some important questions.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="28068"><em>Won’t that be hard, because of the trust that people put in their doctors, just as you said?

And if they’ve got good information, I think they will act on that good information.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="527" data-total-count="28791">Now, there are distortions in the system, everything from the drug salesmen and junkets to how reimbursements occur. Some of those things government has control over; some of those things are just more embedded in our medical culture. But the doctors I know — both ones who treat me as well as friends of mine — I think take their job very seriously and are thinking in terms of what’s best for the patient. They operate within particular incentive structures, like anybody else, and particular habits, like anybody else.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="531" data-total-count="29322">And so if it turns out that doctors in <location code-source="nyt-geo" location-code="realestate:::Find Real Estate listings and community news for Florida:::http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/florida/index.html||||travel:::Go to the Florida Travel Guide.:::http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/florida/overview.html" style="Y"><alt-code idsrc="nyt-geo" value="Florida"></alt-code>Florida</location> are spending 25 percent more on treating their patients as doctors in <location code-source="nyt-geo" location-code="travel:::Go to the Minnesota Travel Guide.:::http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/minnesota/overview.html" style="Y"><alt-code idsrc="nyt-geo" value="Minnesota"></alt-code>Minnesota</location>, and the doctors in Minnesota are getting outcomes that are just as good — then us going down to Florida and pointing out that this is how folks in Minnesota are doing it and they seem to be getting pretty good outcomes, and are there particular reasons why you’re doing what you’re doing? — I think that conversation will ultimately yield some significant savings and some significant benefits.</p><div id="story-ad-9" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="148" data-total-count="29470" id="story-continues-11">Now, I actually think that the tougher issue around medical care — it’s a related one — is what you do around things like end-of-life care —</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="52" data-total-count="29522"><em>Yes, where it’s $20,000 for an extra week of life.</em></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="394" data-total-count="29916"><strong>THE PRESIDENT: </strong>Exactly. And I just recently went through this. I mean, I’ve told this story, maybe not publicly, but when my grandmother got very ill during the campaign, she got <classifier idsrc="nyt-classifier" class="Topic" type="Topic" value="health:::In-depth reference and news articles about Cancer.:::http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html"><alt-code idsrc="nyt-classifier" value="Cancer"></alt-code>cancer</classifier>; it was determined to be terminal. And about two or three weeks after her diagnosis she fell, broke her hip. It was determined that she might have had a mild stroke, which is what had precipitated the fall.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="463" data-total-count="30379">So now she’s in the hospital, and the doctor says, Look, you’ve got about — maybe you have three months, maybe you have six months, maybe you have nine months to live. Because of the weakness of your heart, if you have an operation on your hip there are certain risks that — you know, your heart can’t take it. On the other hand, if you just sit there with your hip like this, you’re just going to waste away and your quality of life will be terrible.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="158" data-total-count="30537">And she elected to get the hip replacement and was fine for about two weeks after the hip replacement, and then suddenly just — you know, things fell apart.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="565" data-total-count="31102">I don’t know how much that hip replacement cost. I would have paid out of pocket for that hip replacement just because she’s my grandmother. Whether, sort of in the aggregate, society making those decisions to give my grandmother, or everybody else’s aging grandparents or parents, a hip replacement when they’re terminally ill is a sustainable model, is a very difficult question. If somebody told me that my grandmother couldn’t have a hip replacement and she had to lie there in misery in the waning days of her life — that would be pretty upsetting.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="84" data-total-count="31186"><em>And it’s going to be hard for people who don’t have the option of paying for it.</em></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="140" data-total-count="31326"><strong>THE PRESIDENT:</strong> So that’s where I think you just get into some very difficult moral issues. But that’s also a huge driver of cost, right?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="149" data-total-count="31475">I mean, the chronically ill and those toward the end of their lives are accounting for potentially 80 percent of the total health care bill out here.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="41" data-total-count="31516"><em>So how do you — how do we deal with it?</em></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="656" data-total-count="32172"><strong>THE PRESIDENT:</strong> Well, I think that there is going to have to be a conversation that is guided by doctors, scientists, ethicists. And then there is going to have to be a very difficult democratic conversation that takes place. It is very difficult to imagine the country making those decisions just through the normal political channels. And that’s part of why you have to have some independent group that can give you guidance. It’s not determinative, but I think has to be able to give you some guidance. And that’s part of what I suspect you’ll see emerging out of the various health care conversations that are taking place on the Hill right now.</p><div id="story-ad-10" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

So I’ve got to make some good arguments out there.

And so the degree of desperation and the shock to the system may not be as great. And that means that there’s going to be more resistance to any of these steps: reforming the financial system or reforming our health care system or doing something about energy. On each of these things — you know, things aren’t so bad in the eyes of a lot of Americans that they say, We’re willing to completely try something new.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="118" data-total-count="33770">But part of my job I think is to bridge that gap between the status quo and what we know we have to do for our future.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="281" data-total-count="34051"><em>Are you worried that the economic cycle will make that much harder?

It’s not one of these things where I can say, Oh, you know what, if I time it just right, then the market is going to be going up and unemployment will be going down right before re-election. These are much bigger, much more systemic problems. And so in some ways you just kind of set aside the politics.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="508" data-total-count="35296">What I’m very confident about is that given the difficult options before us, we are making good, thoughtful decisions. I have enormous confidence that we are weighing all our options and we are making the best choices. That doesn’t mean that every choice is going to be right, is going to work exactly the way we want it to. But I wake up in the morning and go to bed at night feeling that the direction we are trying to move the economy toward is the right one and that the decisions we make are sound.<span class="tombstone"><i class="icon"></i></span></p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
