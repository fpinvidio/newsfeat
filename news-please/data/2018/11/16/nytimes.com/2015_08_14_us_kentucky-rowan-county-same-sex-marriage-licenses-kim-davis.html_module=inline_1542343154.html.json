Ms. Davis is one of two county clerks — the state has 120 — who have defied Governor Beshear’s directive. She is also suing the governor, claiming that he violated her religious freedom.\n“Her case will go nowhere,” said Katherine Franke, an expert on sexuality law, as well as religious exemptions, at Columbia Law School, earlier this week, adding that previous cases in which public officials have sought not to perform their duties on religious grounds have ended much the same way. “She doesn’t get to pick and choose which of her duties she will perform.”\nBut Christian conservatives are watching closely.\n“This case could be a marker of how the religious freedom aspects of same-sex marriage are going to be worked out,” said Roger Gannam, who represents Ms. Davis on behalf of Liberty Counsel, a nonprofit organization in Florida that specializes in religious exceptions cases. “Many in Christian circles believe we are only now beginning the culture wars over marriage.”\nThose culture wars are playing out with vigor in Morehead and Rowan County, where some churches sent congregants by the busload to rally for Ms. Davis when she appeared in court. “We feel very proud of her,” said the Rev. Harley Sexton Jr. of Sharkey Freewill Baptist Church, “that she has taken a religious stand against the state.”\nImage April Miller and Karen Roberts displayed their gemstone bands.

At a downtown coffee shop and bookstore, where organic soaps and locally made jewelry share display space with books, even patrons uncomfortable with same-sex marriage said this week that Ms. Davis must follow the new law of the land.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/us/kentucky-rowan-county-same-sex-marriage-licenses-kim-davis.html?module=inline"}
