The bribes, which the prosecutors said were paid from 2009 to 2014, were related to contracts with construction companies building a third plant, Angra 3, near Rio de Janeiro.\nDuring the military dictatorship, which lasted from 1964 to 1985, Mr. Pinheiro da Silva, a nuclear engineer educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, oversaw a clandestine operation to build reactors for submarines.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/world/americas/brazil-arrests-nuclear-chief-in-widening-of-graft-case.html?_r=0&module=inline"}
