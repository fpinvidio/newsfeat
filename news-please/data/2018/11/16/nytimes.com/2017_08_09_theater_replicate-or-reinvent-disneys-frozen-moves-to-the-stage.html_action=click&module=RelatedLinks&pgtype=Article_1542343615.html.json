But “Frozen” is a major career break for both of them.\n“We know that we’ve got a big project on our hands,” Ms. Murin said.\n“I knew what a massive opportunity this was, and how special it would be to be creating this character for the stage,” Ms. Levy agreed. “I never thought I’d get to be a Disney princess, that’s for sure.”\nThe pair will lead a company with a large cast (40 performers) and a big orchestra (22 musicians). The doors to the palace are 20 feet high. And there are 64 wigs.\nOne unusual, although not unprecedented, element of the “Frozen” development is that the actors and stage managers involved will share in any profits the show makes.\nProfit-sharing has become an increasingly hot topic in commercial theater, particularly because of the enormous success of “Hamilton.” That show’s cast hired a lawyer to successfully press for profit-sharing when it became clear it was going to be a long-running hit, and Disney has decided that 0.5 percent of any profits from “Frozen” will go to actors and stage members represented by Actors’ Equity and hired to work on the show between the fall of 2016 and the Broadway opening.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/theater/replicate-or-reinvent-disneys-frozen-moves-to-the-stage.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article"}
