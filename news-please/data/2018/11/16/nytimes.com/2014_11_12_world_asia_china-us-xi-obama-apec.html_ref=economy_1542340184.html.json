Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi also agreed to a military accord designed to avert clashes between Chinese and American planes and warships in the tense waters off the Chinese coast, as well as an understanding to cut tariffs for technology products.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/world/asia/china-us-xi-obama-apec.html?ref=economy"}
