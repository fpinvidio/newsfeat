This can take as little as 20 minutes or as long as 30, depending on how large your pan is and how high the heat is. If the onions seem to be taking forever — or if you’re really, really hungry — crank up the flame and stir them a lot. Just don’t turn your back, or they may burn. Getting them dark brown is perfectly fine, but even a few black shards will make the whole pan taste bitter, so don’t stray too far from the stove.\nWhile the onions cook, you can boil your pasta. I routinely splurge on pasta because even though it may seem a little crazy to pay upward of $6 for a bag of spaghetti, I can really taste the difference. The texture can be a lot better, too, with a firmer, meatier bite. But use whatever you’ve got in your pantry. After all, isn’t that point?", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/dining/pantry-pasta-recipe.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2FA%20Good%20Appetite"}
