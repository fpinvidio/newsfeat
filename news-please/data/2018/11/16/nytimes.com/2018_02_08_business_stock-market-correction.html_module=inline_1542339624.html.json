After tumbling in recent weeks, the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500-stock index closed on Thursday in that territory.\nWhat is a stock market correction?\nA correction is a 10 percent drop in stocks from their peak. Since Jan. 26, the S.&P. 500 has fallen 10.16 percent.\nIn some ways, 10 percent is an arbitrary threshold. But it often signals that investors have turned more pessimistic about the markets.\nDoes this mean stocks are headed down even further?\nNot necessarily.\nOver the past 20 years, there have been 10 corrections in the S.&P. 500, including the current one, according to Yardeni Research. The previous correction ended in February 2016.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/business/stock-market-correction.html?module=inline"}
