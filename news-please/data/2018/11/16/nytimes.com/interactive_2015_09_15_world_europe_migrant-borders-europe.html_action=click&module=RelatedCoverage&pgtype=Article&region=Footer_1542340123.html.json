It also increased security along the Evros River, which forms the remainder of the border. This is the first of several barriers that merely diverted the flow of migrants from Turkey, pushing them to Bulgaria or onto boats headed for Greek islands in the Aegean Sea.

Macedonia has since focused on quickly moving migrants north to Serbia.\nZoltan Balogh/MTI, via Associated Press\nBudapest AUSTRIA Plan for fence along part of border HUNGARY Roszke ROMANIA Fences constructed this year SERBIA CROATIA Budapest Plan for fence along part of border HUNGARY Roszke ROMANIA Fences constructed this year SERBIA CROATIA Serbia → Hungary Hungary Tries to Seal Its Borders Zoltan Balogh/MTI, via Associated Press Budapest AUSTRIA Plan for fence along part of border HUNGARY Roszke ROMANIA Fences constructed this year SERBIA CROATIA Budapest Plan for fence along part of border HUNGARY Roszke ROMANIA Fences constructed this year SERBIA CROATIA Hungary said on Friday that it would close its 216-mile border with Croatia at midnight.
