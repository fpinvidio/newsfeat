That is likely to increase calls from the financial industry and its allies in the Trump administration and Congress to start watering down the regulations.\nEven the Fed governor overseeing the tests this year has said he wants to pull back some rules.\nThe stress tests, which were introduced early in the Obama administration and are required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, are intended to ensure that banks have enough capital to cover severe losses like those sustained during the mortgage crisis and to avoid another taxpayer-funded bailout.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/business/dealbook/bank-stress-test.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
