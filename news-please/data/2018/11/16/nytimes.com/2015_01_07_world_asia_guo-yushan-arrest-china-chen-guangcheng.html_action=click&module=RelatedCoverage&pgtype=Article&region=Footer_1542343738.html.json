Last month, a Beijing district court sentenced the maker of a documentary on the Chinese Constitution, Shen Yongping, to a year in prison on the same charge. Mr. Shen’s lawyer called the charge an outrage and said Mr. Shen had not made the film for profit. It had been posted online and was available as a free download.\nXi Jinping, the Chinese president and leader of the Communist Party, has taken a tough line against dissent, and many rights advocates have been detained since he took power in November 2012. His leftist ideology with anti-Western overtones has emboldened conservatives to go on the attack against liberal voices.\nMr. Guo has no lawyer at the moment because his lawyer, Xia Lin, was detained by officials in November, said Hu Jia, a rights activist who is a friend of Mr. Guo’s. Mr. Xia had also represented Pu Zhiqiang, a well-known rights lawyer now in official custody who was charged in June with “creating a public disturbance.” Mr. Pu had attended a gathering in May at a scholar’s home in Beijing to honor the victims of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.\nIn April 2012, Mr. Chen, who is blind, was aided by other rights advocates in an escape from police officers who were keeping him and his family under house arrest in Shandong Province. He managed to make his way to the United States Embassy in Beijing, setting off a brief period of high diplomatic tension between America and China.\nHillary Rodham Clinton, then the American secretary of state, negotiated with Chinese officials to allow Mr. Chen to go to New York. He has remained in the United States, and his relatives say they are still being harassed by the police in his hometown.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/world/asia/guo-yushan-arrest-china-chen-guangcheng.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
