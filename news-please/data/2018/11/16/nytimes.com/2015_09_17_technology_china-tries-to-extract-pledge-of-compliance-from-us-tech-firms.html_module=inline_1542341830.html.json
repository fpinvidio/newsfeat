The document begins with the statement: “Our company agrees to strictly adhere to the two key principles” and names them as “not harming national security and not harming consumer rights.” It also asks the company to make six additional promises — some seemingly innocuous, like guaranteeing product safety, and others less so, like volunteering to check that products are “secure and controllable.” That could imply an agreement to cater products to Chinese surveillance.\nOver the last year, Chinese officials have sought to persuade American companies to support declarations of differing types. In a conference hosted by China’s Internet regulator last year, attendees were given little time to provide feedback on a declaration that said countries should have the right to make their own Internet laws, even if those laws mandate censorship and surveillance. The declaration was ultimately abandoned because of objections.\nSigning the new pledge could set a precedent of American tech firms openly cooperating with Beijing and enabling snooping on users. Conversely, a refusal could bring fresh restrictions or penalties for companies in China’s enormous market.\nFor the most part, American firms have sought to follow Beijing’s wishes in China, while lobbying at home for more pushback against Chinese laws that they say restrict market access and force technology transfers.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nTo protect their businesses in China, some have transferred intellectual property and cooperated with would-be Chinese competitors. Some have promised huge new investments and used jargon favored by the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.\nIn a recent speech, Travis Kalanick, chief executive of the ride-hailing company Uber, said that progress brought by his company had to be “in harmony with stability,” words often used by Chinese officials to signal the dangers of social and political unrest. IBM’s China marketing materials use phrases like “building a harmonious society” and “the Chinese dream,” the latter a phrase coined by Mr. Xi to signify the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In June, Cisco pledged $10 billion in investment in China over the next several years. Qualcomm earlier this year said it would help a Chinese chip maker develop advanced semiconductor materials, and IBM transferred intellectual property for one of its lines of servers to a Chinese firm.\nQualcomm declined to comment. Cisco and Dell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n“Everyone has assumed that it is easier in the market if you are seen as a friend of China,” said Adam Segal, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “People have doubled down on that strategy now that the pressure has increased so dramatically.”\nA report released Thursday by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, an industry research group, took aim at what it described as China’s mercantilist approach to innovative industries. The report said the United States should establish an industrial intelligence council, create the position of chief trade enforcement officer and restructure the way reviews of foreign investments on national security grounds are conducted.\n“Disregard for international rules of market-based competition is increasingly apparent as China continues to develop a robust set of mercantilist policies, virtually all of which violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the World Trade Organization’s laws,” the report said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/technology/china-tries-to-extract-pledge-of-compliance-from-us-tech-firms.html?module=inline"}
