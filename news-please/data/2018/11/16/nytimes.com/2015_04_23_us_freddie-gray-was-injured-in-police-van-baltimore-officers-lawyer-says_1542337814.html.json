Aside from the severed spinal cord, an autopsy showed no wounds, and the video does not show the police acting forcefully.\nWhen and how Mr. Gray was injured is a matter of contention between the police and their critics, who say that the screams heard in the video came from Mr. Gray and indicate that he was injured before he was placed in the van. But Mr. Davey said it was possible that Mr. Gray was yelling to draw attention.\n“It’s clear something happened in the van,” he said.\nThe six officers involved in the arrest were suspended with pay on Tuesday, and police investigators are expected to finish their inquiry by May 1 and send the findings to the state’s attorney for Baltimore, Marilyn J. Mosby, for possible prosecution. The Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation.\nMr. Davey said five of the officers had given statements to investigators after the arrest, and only one officer had not cooperated with investigators. He contradicted earlier statements by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who said in interviews that officials had not “fully engaged” the officers involved in Mr. Gray’s arrest.\n“They have completely cooperated with investigators from Day 1,” Mr. Davey said.\nThe officers “have the right to speak to the police, and they have a right not to speak to the police,” Mr. Davey said. He added that he would have advised the officers not to cooperate had he been contacted before they did so.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/us/freddie-gray-was-injured-in-police-van-baltimore-officers-lawyer-says.html"}
