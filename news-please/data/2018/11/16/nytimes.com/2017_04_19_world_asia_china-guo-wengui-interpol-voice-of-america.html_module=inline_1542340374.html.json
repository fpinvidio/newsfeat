In March, he accused the son of a former top Communist Party official of corruption. On April 15, The New York Times, citing corporate records and an interview with one of the official’s relatives, reported that some of his allegations could be substantiated.\nChina asked Interpol to issue a so-called red notice to its member countries for Mr. Guo’s arrest, Lu Kang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, told reporters on Wednesday in Beijing. Mr. Lu said that the notice had been issued, but that Mr. Guo’s name does not appear on Interpol’s wanted list. Interpol, in a statement, said that any of its 190 member countries could request that wanted notices not be publicized.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/world/asia/china-guo-wengui-interpol-voice-of-america.html?module=inline"}
