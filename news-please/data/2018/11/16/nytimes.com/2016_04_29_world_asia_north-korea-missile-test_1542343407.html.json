Hours after that attempt, North Korea fired another missile of the same type, but that test also failed, the ministry said.\nThursday’s attempts bring the total failures in launching the Musudan — one of the North’s most powerful missiles deployed or under development — to three in the past two weeks, according to South Korean officials.\nImage The leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, in October 2015.
