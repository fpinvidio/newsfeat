She decided on the spot that the huge complex was for them.\nThe grounds were well kept, the No. 6 subway train was there to take them to their jobs in Manhattan, playgrounds for their 5-year-old daughter were numerous, and the sidewalks were filled with young families like theirs, Ms. Miranda said.\nOn Sept. 1, a month after their second daughter was born, the family moved into a two-bedroom rental, paying $1,605 a month.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/realestate/parkchester-the-bronx-working-as-planned.html?module=inline"}
