Orentlicher, an expert on international law who is deputy for war crimes issues at the State Department. (She is not connected to the case.)\n“They acted on a starkly simple belief — that malignant governance, enforced by a daily assault against human dignity, could not possibly be legal,” she said in an e-mail.\nMr. Swift has fought resistance not only from the Marcos family but also from the Philippine, United States and Swiss governments, which have argued that all recovered assets belong to the Philippine government.\nBills are pending in the Philippine Congress to allow at least some assets to be allocated to victims of human rights abuses.\n“Twenty-five years is an extremely long time for any litigation to take place,” Mr. Swift said. “It’s not a great amount, it’s not an adequate amount, but it’s a start.” He said other court cases were pending in New York and Singapore involving an additional total that he put at $68 million.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It ordered them to pay a fine of $353.6 million for the victims’ benefit.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n“There may have been abuses, but they were never a part of the policy of my father’s administration,” Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said in an interview on Monday. “Although there were individual abuses, I cannot see how his administration per se can be liable for that.”\nAt an emotional ceremony awarding the first 12 payments in Manila, Mr. Swift said the recovery of the Marcos assets was “exceedingly difficult.”\n“It’s unnecessary and unsavory of the Philippine government to oppose its most abused and oppressed citizens,” he said, addressing President Benigno S. Aquino III. “Twenty-five years is long enough, Mr. President. It’s time to reach a final settlement.”\nThe recipients included an American Maryknoll priest, the Rev. Edward Gerlock, who was imprisoned and deported in 1972, during martial law, for helping farmers defend their land against the encroachments of American fruit companies.\nAnother recipient, Hilda Narciso, was jailed and raped repeatedly and wrote an account of her sufferings that became a focal point for opposition to the abuses.\nFe B. Mangahas, a former opposition member, accepted her check “on behalf of my co-teachers, students who lost their lives and also women who were raped, parents whose children just simply disappeared.”\nJust before the check recipients posed for pictures, Mr. Olegario said: “I don’t think I’ll ever experience a more beautiful and happy day. I say to my son, wherever he is, ‘Jun, this is a happy day for all of us.’ ”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/world/asia/02philippines.html"}
