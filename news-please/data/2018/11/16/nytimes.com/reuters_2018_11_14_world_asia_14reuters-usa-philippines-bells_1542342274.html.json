WARREN AIR FORCE BASE, Wyo. â€” U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday formally returned church bells to the Philippines that were taken as war trophies over a century ago following gruesome clashes, seeking to close a contentious chapter in the two allies' shared history.\nThe decision to return the \"Bells of Balangiga\" to the Philippines ends a decades-long quest by Manila, including by President Rodrigo Duterte, and is expected to bolster U.S.-Philippines' relations.\nBut it has upset some U.S. veterans and Wyoming's delegation to the U.S. Congress, which uniformly opposed returning bells that were a memorial to the 45 U.S. soldiers who were killed during a surprise attack on Sept. 28, 1901, in the central town of Balangiga.\nTwo of the three bells have been on display at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. The third bell is at a U.S. Army museum in South Korea.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/11/14/world/asia/14reuters-usa-philippines-bells.html"}
