Kennedy Human Rights group, which plans to raise at least $5 million to fund the releases. While there have been other so-called mass bailouts around the country, organizers said they believe this effort at Rikers has the potential to be one of the largest ever.\n“The crux of the issue is that in New York City, we criminalize poverty,” Kerry Kennedy, president of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, said in an interview on Wednesday. “There are no wealthy people on Rikers Island because if you are wealthy, you go free because you make bail.\n“For a week or 10 days, we want to show we can have a system of justice that works,” she added.\nThe group has organized 200 volunteers who, starting in October, will bail women out from the Rose M. Singer Center, and will arrange the release of 16- and 17-year-olds from the Robert N. Davoren Complex, perhaps aiding the city in its goal to close those jails more quickly than planned.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/nyregion/rikers-island-inmate-population.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
