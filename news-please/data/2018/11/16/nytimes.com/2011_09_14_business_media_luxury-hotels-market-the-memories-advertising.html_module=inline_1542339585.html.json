Among them: “Let us invent a drink in your honor,” “Let us take you snorkeling by moonlight,” “Let us turn a weekend getaway into a honeymoon you never thought you’d have,” “Let us introduce your kids to a loggerhead turtle,” “Let us re-create the recipe from your favorite meal in Paris” and “Let us make you captain of your very own ship.”\nThe videos in the Orient-Express campaign chronicle the “unique experiences” enjoyed by the Astorbilt family, which may remind viewers of other make-believe brand families, assembled by fashion labels, like the Diors and the Hilfigers.\nVideo\nThe clips follow the Astorbilts — father Duke, mother Lauren, son Maximillian and daughter Penelope — as they travel and stay at properties like the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro; the Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge and the Hotel Monasterio, both in Peru; and the Hotel Cipriani in Venice. And they also travel on the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.\n“The idea is to create a world around each character,” said Richard Christiansen, creative director at Chandelier Creative in New York, the Orient-Express creative agency, rather than to follow the template for hotel advertising and “talk about a service and a room.”\n“This had to be more editorial, more cinematic” than traditional lodging campaigns, he added, “so it feels like experiences, the experiences you get on a journey.”\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

According to Kantar Media, part of WPP, Ritz-Carlton spent $13.5 million on ads last year, $9.1 million in 2009, $17.6 million in 2008 and $22.1 million in 2007.\nOrient-Express is spending about $1 million on its campaign. According to Kantar Media, Orient-Express spent $495,000 on ads last year, $158,000 in 2009, $496,000 in 2008 and $408,000 in 2007.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/business/media/luxury-hotels-market-the-memories-advertising.html?module=inline"}
