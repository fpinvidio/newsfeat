Today’s solve is pretty effervescent, really, and a refreshing pause for a Thursday. You still might want to share it with a friend. Just make sure to obey your thirst, O.K.?\nTricky Clues\nBy the time Thursday rolls around, expect those unfamiliar names. I didn’t know NANCE or NINA, and although I remember “Beasts of the Southern Wild” I forgot ANNIE.\n15A: Some slang, written down, looks wrong to me even when it’s right. It doesn’t have to be modern (copacetic is a personal example and that’s old), but the word clued here by “Yay!” enters in the grid as WOOT and looks weird. I think the origin here is old-school texting and the word might have looked more charming with a combination of o’s and zeros, wo0t, looking a bit like Bill the Cat, who might also not really be modern anymore. In related news, there’s also a YOLO sighting in this grid, appropriately clued.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2018-10-04.html"}
