She has covered papal conclaves (two), Vatican trials (three), Italian presidents (four), Italian governments (16, in seven legislatures), and Rome’s homeless cat population.\r\nMs. Povoledo has reported on migration since refugees and economic migrants first began coming to Italy in substantial numbers in the early 1990s, and has tracked social changes as Italy’s once-booming economy sputtered nearly to a standstill.\r\nShe has monitored Italy’s changeable political scene, from the transmutation of the once-powerful Italian Communist Party into the party today led by former prime minister Matteo Renzi, to the rise and fall (and possible resuscitation) of the media mogul Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party and its incarnations. She has closely followed the Five Star Movement from its inception as an anti-establishment protest to its taking Italy’s capital in mayoral elections in 2016.\r\nFor years, she closely monitored the tug-of-war between American museums and Italian culture authorities over the return of ill-gotten archaeological artifacts, and continues to write about art theft.\r\nHer articles have appeared in several anthologies.\r\nMs. Povoledo is Italian, and grew up in Italy and Canada. She studied history and political science at the University of Winnipeg, and received a master’s degree in art history from McGill University in Montreal, specializing in Roman Baroque art.", "filename": "by_elisabetta-povoledo_1542338150.html", "image_url": "https://static.nytimes.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "language": "en", "localpath": "/Users/federicoperezinvidio/Projects/illinois/newsfeat/news-please//data/2018/11/16/nytimes.com/by_elisabetta-povoledo_1542338150.html", "title": "Elisabetta Povoledo", "title_page": "Elisabetta Povoledo", "title_rss": "NULL", "source_domain": "nytimes.com", "text": "Elisabetta Povoledo has been writing about Italy for nearly three decades, and has been working for The New York Times and its affiliates since 1992.
