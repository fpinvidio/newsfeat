After a tense diplomatic standoff in May, Chinese officials allowed Mr. Chen and his family to move to the United States.\nRights advocates criticized the prosecution of Mr. Chen’s nephew, saying it was rife with irregularities and little more than a thinly concealed act of revenge. The younger Mr. Chen has been held incommunicado since his arrest in early May, and the authorities repeatedly rejected his family’s legal defense team. Even his court-appointed lawyer said he was not informed of the trial’s start date until shortly before it began, according to Mr. Chen’s father, who was barred from entering the courtroom along with his wife. Prosecutors did not allow any defense witnesses.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe verdict, three years and three months in prison, was rendered with uncharacteristic speed.\n“What an incredible farce,” said Jerome A. Cohen, a law professor at New York University who helped arrange a fellowship at the university for Chen Guangcheng.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Family members say the men, who were wearing street clothes, did not identify themselves. “Of course Kegui is innocent,” his father, Chen Guangfu, said by telephone outside the courthouse. “He was only defending himself and his mother against thugs who broke into the house at midnight.”\nIn its departure from established legal norms, the trial was similar to the one Yinan officials held in 2006 for Chen Guangcheng after he infuriated them by drawing attention to local coercive family-planning practices. At the time, neither Mr. Chen’s lawyers nor his wife were allowed into the courtroom; his conviction came after a breezy two-hour hearing. His sentence of four years and three months stemmed from charges of “damaging property and organizing a mob to disturb traffic,” even though he was under house arrest when a crowd of supporters staged a protest against his detention.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/world/asia/nephew-of-chinese-dissident-chen-guangcheng-given-3-years-in-prison-for-assault.html?ref=asia"}
