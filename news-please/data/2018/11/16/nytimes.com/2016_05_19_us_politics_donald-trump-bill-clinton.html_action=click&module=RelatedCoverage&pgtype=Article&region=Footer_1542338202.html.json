Trump escalated his attacks on former President Bill Clinton’s past in an interview on Wednesday with Sean Hannity on Fox News, bringing up an old allegation of rape.\nDiscussing a recent New York Times article regarding Mr. Trump’s history with women, Mr. Hannity led Mr. Trump down a line of questioning, naming women who had accused Mr. Clinton of sexual misconduct.\n“For example, I looked at The New York Times,” Mr. Hannity said. “Are they going to interview Juanita Broaddrick? Are they going to interview Paula Jones? Are they going to interview Kathleen Willey?”\nHe continued: “In one case, it’s about exposure. In another case, it’s about groping and fondling and touching against a woman’s will.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/us/politics/donald-trump-bill-clinton.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
