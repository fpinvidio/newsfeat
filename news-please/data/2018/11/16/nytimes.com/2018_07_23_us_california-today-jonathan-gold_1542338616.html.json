Here’s the sign-up.)\nThe police briefing on a hostage-taking at a Trader Joe's in Silver Lake that gripped Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon had just ended. But as Mayor Eric M.

Or that it inspired a day of tributes from shocked admirers. (He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in early July.) “We are all so heartbroken,” Roy Choi, the chef behind Kogi, a Korean taco food truck, said on Instagram.\nFor many people, the joy of Saturday mornings was turning — even before coffee — to Mr. Gold’s latest inside the Saturday section.
