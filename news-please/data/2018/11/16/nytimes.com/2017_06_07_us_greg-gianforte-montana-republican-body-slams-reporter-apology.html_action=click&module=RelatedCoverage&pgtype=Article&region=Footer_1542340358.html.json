My treatment of you did not meet that standard,” Mr. Gianforte, 56, who won Montana’s lone seat in the House on May 25, wrote. “You did not initiate any physical contact with me, and I had no right to assault you.”\nMr. Jacobs accepted the congressman-elect’s apology, he said in a statement. “I hope the constructive resolution of this incident reinforces for all the importance of respecting the freedom of the press and the First Amendment and encourages more civil and thoughtful discourse in our country,” Mr. Jacobs said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/us/greg-gianforte-montana-republican-body-slams-reporter-apology.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
