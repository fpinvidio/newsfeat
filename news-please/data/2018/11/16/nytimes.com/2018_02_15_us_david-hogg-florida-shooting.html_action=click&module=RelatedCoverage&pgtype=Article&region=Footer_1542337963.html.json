Then, he said, came the sound of thousands of student footsteps, and Mr. Hogg and his classmates raced out the door, joining a giant wave of teenagers.\n“There was a tsunami of people running in one specific direction away from something,” he said, “and that’s what we were doing. It was almost like there was a shark coming along and we were a school of fish. And we were running from that armed man.”\nA janitor appeared and began to wave. “Stop, stop!” he said. “Go over here!”\nThen the school chef opened a door to her office, Mr. Hogg said, and hurried the teenagers in — first 10, then 20, then some 30 or 40 students crowded in the office. They shut off the lights. And then students turned to their phones, and began the horrifying experience of watching a school shooting unfold at their own school — through the news apps on their phones.\nWhile they were hiding, Mr. Hogg proceeded to interview his classmates on camera about their beliefs on gun policy.\nMr. Hogg’s younger sister, 14, was also in the building. Two of her best friends were among the 17 people who died, he said.\n“On a national scale, I’m not surprised at all,” he said of the shooting. “And that’s just sad. The fact that a student is not surprised that there was another mass shooting — but this time it was at his school — says so much about the current state that our country is in, and how much has to be done.”\nThe violence must stop, he said, issuing a call to pressure lawmakers to act to make schools safer.\n“We need to do something. We need to get out there and be politically active. Congress needs to get over their political bias with each other and work toward saving children’s lives.”\nIn an interview with CNN earlier on Thursday, Mr. Hogg expressed his frustration with politicians in simpler terms: “We’re children,” he said. “You guys are the adults.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/david-hogg-florida-shooting.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
