Illuminati are behind it.”\n“Do you still treat your kids with leaves? No? And why don’t you #vaccinate them?

Their only intent, the study concluded, seemed to be to raise the level of hostility.\n“You see this pattern,” said David A. Broniatowski , a computer engineer at George Washington University and lead author of the study, which was published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health. “On guns, or race, these accounts take opposite sides in lots of debates. They’re about sowing discord.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/health/russian-trolls-vaccines.html"}
