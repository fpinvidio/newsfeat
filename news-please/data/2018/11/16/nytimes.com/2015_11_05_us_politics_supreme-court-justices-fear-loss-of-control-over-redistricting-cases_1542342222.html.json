They did not want to close the door entirely on challenges to gerrymandering, but they also did not want to be required to rule on them.\nThough the court has never rejected a voting district on the ground that it gave a political party an unconstitutional advantage, it has never ruled out that such a district might exist. On Wednesday, the court seemed inclined to endorse procedures that would at least treat such claims seriously by sending them to special three-judge courts created by a federal law for redistricting cases.\nBut as the argument drew to a close, several justices voiced a competing concern — the law also allows direct appeals to the Supreme Court from rulings of the three-judge courts, meaning more work and less discretion for the justices.\nThe case, Shapiro v. McManus, No. 14-990, is a challenge to Maryland’s 2011 congressional maps. Democrats, the challengers said, had gone to elaborate and unconstitutional lengths to create oddly shaped districts to favor their candidates.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/us/politics/supreme-court-justices-fear-loss-of-control-over-redistricting-cases.html"}
