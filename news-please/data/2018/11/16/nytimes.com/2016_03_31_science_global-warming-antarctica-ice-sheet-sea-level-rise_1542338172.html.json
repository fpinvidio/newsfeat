But researchers long assumed the worst effects would take hundreds — if not thousands — of years to occur.\nNow, new research suggests the disaster scenario could play out much sooner.\nContinued high emissions of heat-trapping gases could launch a disintegration of the ice sheet within decades, according to a study published Wednesday, heaving enough water into the ocean to raise the sea level as much as three feet by the end of this century.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/science/global-warming-antarctica-ice-sheet-sea-level-rise.html"}
