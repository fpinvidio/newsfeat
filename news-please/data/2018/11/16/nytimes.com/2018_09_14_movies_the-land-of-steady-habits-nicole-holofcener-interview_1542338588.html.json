Nicole Holofcener directs the film (in theaters and streaming on Netflix Sept. 14), and adapted Ted Thompson’s novel for the screen.\nIn this scene, Anders has been drinking and gives his taxi driver the incorrect address, that of his former home. But he still has the key and decides to head in, to the dismay of his son (Thomas Mann), his ex-wife (Edie Falco) and her new boyfriend (Bill Camp).", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/movies/the-land-of-steady-habits-nicole-holofcener-interview.html"}
