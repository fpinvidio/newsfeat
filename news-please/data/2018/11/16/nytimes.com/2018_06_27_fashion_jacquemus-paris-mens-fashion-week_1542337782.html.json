Even in our age of global fashion, global communication, global everything, he maintains the earthy terroir of his motherland. For his new men’s collection, he bypassed Paris Fashion Week, where he shows his women’s wear, and headed down to Marseille, on the Mediterranean coast.\nMr. Porte Jacquemus is a Provençal, from Mallemort, an hour outside of Marseille — “a nowhere town,” he said, “really nowhere.” But when he began designing for men, he loved the ideal of a Mediterranean man, and where better to place one? He secured the scenic beach of the Calanque de Sormiou, a national park in Marseille, and off he went.\nThe guys that crowd the coastal beaches are not necessarily fashion types. But fashion types are not necessarily what appeal to Mr. Porte Jacquemus, at least where men’s wear is concerned. He preferred the gritty reality of a little bad taste.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/fashion/jacquemus-paris-mens-fashion-week.html"}
