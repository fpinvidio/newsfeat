His great-grandmother made the first pizzas he ever ate, and he ate them a lot: “Super legit Sicilian grandma pies,” he told me. “Lots of sauce, bread crumbs and olive oil, onions and green olives, very little cheese.”\nFalco liked those pizzas, he said. He really liked them. But he was a child in suburban Texas in the 1990s, and the pizza he loved — passionately — was the one everyone else loved, too: personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut, sweet-sauced and pillowed with mozzarella, above a thick, golden crust. He would tell his grandmother that, and reflecting on the memory now, he said, “I wish I could go back in time and punch that kid in the face.” But not because the Pizza Hut pizzas were bad! They weren’t, Falco said. They were delicious in their own particular way, buttery of crust and stringy with salty cheese, swabbed with sweet red sauce.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/magazine/corporate-delivery-pie-pan-pizza.html"}
