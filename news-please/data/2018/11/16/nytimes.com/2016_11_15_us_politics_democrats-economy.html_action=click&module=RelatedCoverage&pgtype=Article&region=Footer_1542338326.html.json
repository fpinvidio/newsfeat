Trump — a race decided by a handful of Rust Belt states that for decades had favored Democratic nominees — but also after the third campaign in the past four election cycles in which the party was routed across vast sections of the nation, leaving Democrats out of power in both chambers of Congress and in most governors’ mansions.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/democrats-economy.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
