This time, though, security guards and police officers in Kunduz were able to stop the crowd from breaching the walls of the office. But with the situation still volatile senior United Nations officials decided not to take the risk of having international staff remain there.\nDenise Jeanmonod, a United Nations spokeswoman in Kabul, said that about 15 international staff members had left the Kunduz office and returned to Kabul. Only the staff of the Kunduz office has been withdrawn because of the recent unrest, she said.\nThe British, French and German Embassies have withdrawn their international staff from advisory jobs in Afghan ministries, but United Nations employees in advisory jobs in such positions have continued to work in Kabul.\nThe Kunduz staff will return once the United Nations is confident of their safety, Ms. Jeanmonod said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/world/asia/un-withdraws-international-staff-from-kunduz-office.html"}
