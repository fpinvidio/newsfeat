They also may be hard-pressed to finance rebuilding.\n“Absolutely, this is going to be devastating for several years,” said Ester Bivona, former president of the New York State Receivers and Collectors Association, which represents local tax officials.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/nyregion/storm-damaged-homes-mean-lower-property-tax-revenues-in-new-york-region.html"}
