I have a Kindle e-reader and my friend has an Android tablet with the Kindle app on it. Can we lend each other e-books?\nA. Amazon does not require ownership of one of its Kindle e-readers to lend and borrow its Kindle e-books. One or both people can use one of the companyâ€™s many Kindle reading apps for mobile devices and computers to share.\nTo lend a Kindle book to a friend, log in to the Amazon site and go to the Manage My Content and Devices page from the Your Account menu. In your list of purchased Kindle books, select a title in the list and click the Action button next to it. In the Actions menu, select Loan This Title. On the next screen, enter the email address of the book borrower and send the message.\nThe message includes a link to download the lent book. The person then has 14 days to read it, and during that time you will not be able to use that same title. To return a borrowed Kindle e-book, your friend should log into Amazon, go to the Manage My Content and Devices page, select the book and on the Actions menu choose Delete From Library.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/technology/personaltech/lending-kindle-books.html"}
