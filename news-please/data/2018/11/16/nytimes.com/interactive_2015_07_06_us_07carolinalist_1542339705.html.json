If the Senate approves the measure, the debate will shift to the House, where passage is less certain.\nDemands that the flag be taken down emerged after the June 17 massacre of nine people at Emanuel A.M.E.

Here are selected remarks by state senators engaged in Monday's discussion, updated throughout the day.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/06/us/07carolinalist.html"}
