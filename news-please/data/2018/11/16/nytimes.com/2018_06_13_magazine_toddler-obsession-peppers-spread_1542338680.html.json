I’m biased, because I edited it, but the chicken legs braised in pepperonata are fantastic. To make them, you sweat so many peppers in a pot that they just exhale and give up their juices; then you nestle some browned chicken legs into the stew and cook until tender, no wine or stock required. There are, however, tomatoes, oranges, two kinds of chile flakes and three herbs involved.\nBecause I am lazy and a little bit cheap, I thought I’d simplify it. While the chicken and the many ingredients add complexity, the peppers and onions are the stars, so I concentrated on concentrating them. I applied the signature move of my cooking, which is to ask the question “Well, if you cook this a little and it’s good, what happens when you cook the bejeezus out of it?”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/magazine/toddler-obsession-peppers-spread.html"}
