It said the radar system would be positioned in such a way that its powerful signals would pose no threat to human health, an assurance that villagers in Seongju did not accept.\nSouth Koreans are divided over the Thaad system, whose deployment has been sought for years by the United States but angrily opposed by China, South Korea’s top trade partner. China asserts that it, not the North, is the system’s true target, and Russia has joined Beijing in contending that its deployment would compromise their security and worsen tensions in the region, making it even more difficult to persuade North Korea to end its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\nOn Monday, President Park Geun-hye said that the deployment “neither targets third countries nor undermines their security interests.” But critics of the government, including many opposition lawmakers, worry that China will engage in economic retaliation against South Korea and cooperate less on reining in the North’s nuclear ambitions.\n“It will do more harm than good to our national interest,” a prominent opposition leader, Moon Jae-in, said in a statement on Wednesday. He also called on the government to submit the deployment for parliamentary approval.\nUnder its deal with Washington, South Korea will provide land and build the base for the Thaad battery, but the United States will pay for the missile system, to be built by Lockheed Martin, as well as its operational costs.\nSome critics in South Korea found fault with the government’s choice of Seongju as the Thaad site, noting that Seoul, with its 10 million people, will lie outside the coverage of its intercept missiles, which have a range of just under 125 miles. The Defense Ministry said it would operate low-altitude Patriot missile defense systems together with Thaad to help defend the capital.\nOn Monday, North Korea threatened an unspecified “physical counteraction” against the Thaad deployment, which it said was part of an American plan to build “an Asian version of NATO” to secure military hegemony in the region.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/world/asia/south-korea-thaad-us.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
