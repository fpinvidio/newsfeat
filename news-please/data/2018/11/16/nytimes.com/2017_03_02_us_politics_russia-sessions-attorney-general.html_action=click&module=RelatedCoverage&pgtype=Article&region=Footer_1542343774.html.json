As a senator, Mr. Sessions was a top campaign adviser to President Trump.\nBut some Democrats called for giving the investigation even greater independence. Others accused Mr. Sessions of lying under oath and called for his resignation and a criminal investigation. The developments have heightened interest in several related legal issues.\nWhat does it mean for the attorney general to recuse himself?\nGenerally, United States attorneys directly oversee criminal investigations. In a case that raises politically sensitive issues, the attorney general would normally be briefed on proposed major decisions — like whether to subpoena a high-profile witness or bring charges — and could overrule them. By recusing himself now, Mr. Sessions is responding to concerns that exercising that role, in light of his ties to the Trump campaign, would call into question the impartiality of the justice system.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/russia-sessions-attorney-general.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
