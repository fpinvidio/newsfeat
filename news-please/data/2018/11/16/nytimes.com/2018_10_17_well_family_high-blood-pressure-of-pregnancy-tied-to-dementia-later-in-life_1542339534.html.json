In addition to hypertension, the condition can include signs of diminished kidney or liver function.\nResearchers followed the 1,178,005 Danish women who had given birth between 1978 and 2015. More than 58,000 of them had pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. The study is in BMJ.\nHaving pre-eclampsia doubled the risk for vascular dementia, and quadrupled the risk for women over 65. There was a modest association of pre-eclampsia with Alzheimer’s disease, and none with any other type of dementia.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/well/family/high-blood-pressure-of-pregnancy-tied-to-dementia-later-in-life.html"}
