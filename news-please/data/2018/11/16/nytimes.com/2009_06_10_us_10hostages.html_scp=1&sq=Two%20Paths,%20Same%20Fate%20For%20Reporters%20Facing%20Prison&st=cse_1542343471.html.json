Kalee Kreider, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gore, also declined to comment on the specifics of the situation, but said Mr. Gore had been in regular contact with the families of Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee.\nThe two women were working on a story on the China-North Korea border when they were detained in mid-March. Long before that, Ms. Ling, 32, had shown a proclivity for life in front of the camera — her older sister, Lisa Ling, is a successful television reporter — and had been an on-air correspondent for Current since 2005.\nMs. Lee, 36, moved to the United States from South Korea in the mid-1990s and had settled into a quiet, steady life of work and family; she and Mr. Saldate have a 4-year-old daughter. Mr. Saldate, a stand-up comic and actor, was the public performer in the couple; Ms. Lee’s sole appearance on the Current TV Web site is a five-second clip of her holding up a can of soda. “Euna loves Dr Pepper,” the clip is titled.\nMs. Ling grew up with her sister in Carmichael, Calif., where she excelled at school and, according to a friend, Marcus Marquez, charted an ambitious life. She graduated with a communications degree from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1998.\nPhoto\n“She was definitely always smiling, very smart, involved,” Mr. Marquez said. “She really looked up to her sister.”\nHer onetime neighbors said Tuesday that they were incredulous that Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee could be involved in an international incident.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n“They’re not spies, I know that for sure,” said Pat Hozack, 74, who lives next door to the modest two-story house where Ms. Ling grew up and her father still lives. “It all feels unreal.”\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
