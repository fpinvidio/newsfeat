In a few places, like Churchill, Manitoba, bears congregate on land during the summer. But many stay on the ice or find other places to venture onto solid ground.\nResearchers put satellite tracking collars on some of the bears to get an idea of where they move, but would also like to get a picture of their activities and energy use.\nAnthony Pagano, a wildlife biologist with the United States Geological Survey, has been testing accelerometers on the collars — something like Fitbits for bears. The devices respond to activity. For people they are preset to recognize actions like jogging, and show a user how much energy has been expended.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/13/science/science-take-video-polar-bears.html"}
