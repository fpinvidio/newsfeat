With his party winning control of the Senate on the same night, he fulfilled his decades-long dream of becoming majority leader.\nIn capturing a sixth term, Mr. McConnell turned back Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democrat whose campaign as the anti-obstructionist, fueled by the intense passion and giant cash infusions from her party, failed to ever really catch fire.\nNinety minutes after the polls closed, Mr. McConnell thanked supporters at a Marriott in Louisville.\n“I work hard to bring your concerns to Washington, and I will not let up,” he said. Ms. Grimes, he said, “ran a spirited campaign. She earned a lot of votes, and she earned my respect.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-wins-sixth-term-in-us-senate.html"}
