        <h2>A Mixed Recovery</h2>
        <p>
          Industries in the health care and energy sectors grew substantially over the last five years, while jobs in real estate and construction continued to shrink. Industries that paid in the middle of the wage spectrum generally lost jobs. And while the economy overall is back to its pre-recession level, it hasn't added the roughly 10 million jobs needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population.

          Home prices have rebounded from their crisis lows, but home building remains at historically low levels.

      <p class="not-in-mobile">Industry charts are mutually exclusive and represent 115.1 million of all 116.4 million private-sector jobs in the country. Comparable employment and/or earnings data is not available for government jobs or the 1.3 million private-sector jobs we’ve left out. Because earnings data is not available for one of the largest sectors, private education, we’ve calculated it based on earnings for its parent and sister industries.</p>

<p class="not-in-mobile">The graph at the top of this page includes line charts for each industry, shaped by their change in employment over the last decade. The individual lines are placed on the x axis (horizontally) based on the average wages paid in that industry. They are placed on the y axis (vertically) based on the percentage change in employment since the start of the recession in December 2007.</p>

<p>Data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ces/">Current Employment Statistics program</a>, which provides monthly reports based on surveys of businesses in hundreds of industries. We’ve used seasonally adjusted data through April 2014, the latest comprehensive set available.</p>

<p>Average salary data is adjusted for inflation and based on average gross hourly earnings, multiplied by the full-time equivalent of 2,080 hours of work per year (though not all jobs may be full time). Averages are based on salaries for all levels of employees in each industry, from the lowest-paid workers to the highest-paid executives, and is not meant to measure average pay for occupations within industries.</p>

<p>Charts are colored (and labeled) according to the shape of their curves. Industries are considered “relatively unaffected” if they experienced no year-over-year gains and losses, or if they continued to gain jobs throughout the recession.</p>

<p>Industries are labeled “recovered” if employment is back within 6 percent of its pre-recession peak, and they are labeled “recovered and grown” if employment is higher than 6 percent above its pre-recession peak.</p>

<p>Remaining industries are considered “not recovered,” unless employment had already fallen at least 2 percent before the recession (from 2003) and continued to fall at least 3 percent after the recession, in which case they are labeled “Recession accelerated decline.”</p>

<p><b>Correction: June 5, 2014</b><br>Because of a calculation error, a previous version of this graphic stated that industries connected with construction and real estate have lost almost three times as many jobs as health care has added. That number should be closer to 40 percent more, or hundreds of thousands.</p>
