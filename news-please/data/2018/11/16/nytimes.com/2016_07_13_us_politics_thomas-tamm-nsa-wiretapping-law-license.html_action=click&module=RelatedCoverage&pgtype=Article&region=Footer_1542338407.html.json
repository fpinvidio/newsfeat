Tamm, who admitted revealing confidential client information and could have had his law license suspended or been disbarred. That reprimand would enable him to continuing practicing law as an assistant public defender in Maryland.\nIf approved by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the deal would end a decade of investigations into Mr. Tamm. The Justice Department said in 2010 that it had decided not to prosecute him for a crime, but in December, in a surprise move, the District of Columbia bar revived ethics charges against him.\n“This has been going on forever,” said Mr. Tamm’s lawyer, Paul Kemp. “It has taken a huge toll on Tom, and it’s time to end it.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/us/politics/thomas-tamm-nsa-wiretapping-law-license.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
