C. Penney, closed within months of each other.\nThe contrast between the two scenes is an example of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter termed “creative destruction,” the inevitable process in which new industries rise and replace old ones.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/business/economy/amazon-jobs-retail.html?mcubz=1"}
