But as those charged with procurement of wafers and the placement of metal detectors can attest, nothing is simple about a six-day, three-city, two-dozen-event papal trip that is a cross between a military operation, a diplomatic mission and an arena-rock tour.\n“The numbers, the scope of this makes me catch my breath, because it is so big, and at the same time, every little detail has to be just right,” said Donna Farrell, the executive director of the World Meeting of Families. Her Vatican-affiliated group is expecting more than a million guests at the concluding Mass for the Festival of Families on Sunday in Philadelphia.\nThe effort entails a series of seemingly miraculous transformations: box offices and concession stands at Madison Square Garden into confession booths, the Ellipse across from the White House into a half-mile popemobile track, Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia into a viewing corridor lit up like some oversize open-air sports bar with more than 40 Jumbotrons.\nThere are spreadsheets, and spreadsheets of spreadsheets.
