                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">IN presidential elections much is made of the power of incumbency. Who but the president can order up an aircraft carrier for a speaker's platform? But there are perils, too, as George W. Bush is finding. Because when you are the incumbent the election is, fundamentally, about you. On this summer weekend, jammed between the harsh report of the 9/11 commission and the nomination of John Kerry at the Democratic convention, Mr. Bush finds himself in the same difficult place as Harry S. Truman in 1948 and Jimmy Carter in 1980: an incumbent facing a dubious electorate that could tip either way.</p>

But for a president it is quite rare, and at least in the view of some historians and government experts, getting rarer, as a national culture of shifting blame permeates American politics. So it was last week that some powerful words were spoken to the spouses and families of those who died two and a half years ago in the terror of Sept. 11.</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">FOR nearly half a century the cold war world's tense stability was built on a simple bit of political philosophy. Nicknamed, appropriately, MAD, for Mutual Assured Destruction, it held that the leader of a country advanced enough to build nuclear weapons would never actually use them if he was assured his nation would also be obliterated by his enemy. Why call this a political philosophy? Because at its core, as at the core of every political philosophy from Plato to Marx, is an appraisal of human nature. MAD's view of human nature was, paradoxically, surprisingly sunny. It held that a leader, no matter how ambitious, ideological or even nutty, would never be so far gone (or allowed to be so far gone by his cohorts) as to risk the annihilation of his own people.</p>

                    Political Memo; G.O.P. Plagued With Democratic Problems                </h2>
                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">When William J. Bennett backed out of his agreement to become chairman of the Republican National Committee he was walking away from one of the biggest headaches in American politics right now. The Republican Party is rife with problems that have long been associated with the Democrats: ideological schisms, personal bickering, pique parading as principle and individual agendas undermining party unity. There is rising concern among Republicans around the country that at a time when the White House should be pulling the party together, the President is distracted by a range of foreign crises and his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, is more concerned with settling grudges with other powerful Republicans. The absence of Lee Atwater, the party chief who is suffering from an inoperable brain tumor, has become glaringly apparent, many Republicans now say. Mr. Sununu has tried to consolidate the jobs of chief of staff and chief political adviser. This would be difficult for even the most light-footed of operatives. But politically minded Republicans say it has created nothing but grief under Mr. Sununu, who walks across political minefields with all the grace of a raging elephant. Friends insist Mr. Bennett was telling the truth when he announced he could not succed Mr. Atwater because his concerns about conflict of interest would keep him from making as much money as he needed. But they also said that he had long discussions with associates about the seriousness of the party's internal divisions, and that this did nothing to encourage him to overcome the financial obstacles. Indeed, officials in Mr. Sununu's office say they offered to more than double the chairman's salary, to $300,000, to entice Mr. Bennett. But that was said to be less than half of what he could make from speaking fees. So he walked away sending a letter of explanation to the President and holding a news conference in the White House driveway that only added to the sense that the Republican camp is in disarray. "I would not characterize it as chaos," said Eddie Mahe, who helped run the Republican National Committee when Mr. Bush was its chairman. "But it surely could be characterized as confusion. There is no shining beacon on any hill that all forces are moving toward. It's just a mumbo jumbo of forces on a plain." Some of the current problem goes to the very core of the party. Two of the bonding agents of the Republican coalition, opposition to communism and opposition to taxes, have been weakened, one as a result of world events and the other as a result of White House handling of the budget negotiations. On top of these philosophical problems, and in several cases because of them, Washington is being treated to a series of Republican feuds of a sort remarkable even by Washington's standards of pigue, backbiting and infighting. Some news from the battlefield: *Two of the party's best known conservatives, Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development who was a Presidential candidate in 1988, and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the minority whip who hopes to be the next Republican leader of the House, openly rebelled against Mr. Bush's decision to raise taxes to get a budget deal with Democrats and are still battling the White House over domestic policy. *Conservatives of various stripes are talking about a challenge to Mr. Bush for the 1992 Presidential nomination. Pete duPont, the former Delaware Governor and another candidate for the Republican nomination in 1988, is setting up a political committee that some conservatives hope will serve as a vehicle for another Presidential campaign. Aides to Mr. duPont say these are pipe dreams of frustrated conservatives. *Mr. Sununu is barely on speaking terms with Mr. Gingrich and, in a seperate feud, has blocked the President from signing fund-raising letters on behalf of the House Republican Campaign Committee so long as Edward J. Rollins, one of the Republican Party's most outspoken political strategists, is in charge. Mr. Rollins's offense was to suggest during the midterm campaigns that Republican candidates should separate themselves from Mr. Bush's flip-flops on taxes. The grumbling on the right has become so loud that one Republican entrepreneur has even carved out a successful market by selling buttons with the message, "Dan Quayle now." So far, most of this is of fascination to a few thousand political insiders. But Republican operatives fear that the confusion is beginning to plant doubts in the public mind about the competence of the President. That would be nothing more than an irritant if the economy, that great mover of public opinion, were headed up. But it is the last thing Mr. Bush needs as the economy heads down, dragging the President's political standing with it. An Old Argument in New Light Mr. Bush took a list of potential party chairmen to Camp David this weekend. But some Republicans say that what may be more important is who he names to run his re-election campaign. That is the person who will probably emerge as chief political adviser and will provide the counterweight to Mr. Sununu that has been missing since Mr. Atwater became ill. Some of what is going on is a battle for control of the domestic policy agenda. "We are in the middle of an argument which a lot of us thought ended in 1989," Mr. Gingrich said. "There really is a fundemental difference between the managerial/accommodationist approach to the welfare state and the reform/replacement approach." Ideological conservatives like Mr. Gingrich would like the White House to champion a program of low taxes, curtailed bureaucracy, freer markets and the use of Federal funds to increase individual choices in areas like education. A White House conservative, Jim Pinkerton, called this program "the new paradigm" for a post-New Deal conservative agenda. That led to an inside battle when the budget director, Richard G. Darman, seemed to make fun of the idea in a recent speech. Mr. Gingrich, a proponent of Mr. Pinkerton's thesis, said Mr. Darman should be dismissed if he did not embrace the effort to forge a new conservative agenda. Mr. Darman and Mr. Gingrich have held about 12 hours of meetings since their blow-up, Mr. Gingrich's staff reports. The mood between the two men is said to be better now, and Mr. Gingrich's camp at least credits Mr. Darman with showing enough respect for the new paradigmists to debate their ideas. But the big test, the conservatives say, will be what Mr. Bush says in his budget and State of the Union Message about domestic policy. Mr. Sununu tried to address some of that in a speech this week, saying that whether it was called the new paradigm or something else the cornerstone of Mr. Bush's domestic policy was the encouragement of capitalism and the expansion of free markets.</p>

Who but the president can order up an aircraft carrier for a speaker's platform? But there are perils, too, as George W. Bush is finding. Because when you are the incumbent the election is, fundamentally, about you. On this summer weekend, jammed between the harsh report of the 9/11 commission and the nomination of John Kerry at the Democratic convention, Mr. Bush finds himself in the same difficult place as Harry S. Truman in 1948 and Jimmy Carter in 1980: an incumbent facing a dubious electorate that could tip either way.</p>

                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">FOR nearly half a century the cold war world's tense stability was built on a simple bit of political philosophy. Nicknamed, appropriately, MAD, for Mutual Assured Destruction, it held that the leader of a country advanced enough to build nuclear weapons would never actually use them if he was assured his nation would also be obliterated by his enemy. Why call this a political philosophy? Because at its core, as at the core of every political philosophy from Plato to Marx, is an appraisal of human nature. MAD's view of human nature was, paradoxically, surprisingly sunny. It held that a leader, no matter how ambitious, ideological or even nutty, would never be so far gone (or allowed to be so far gone by his cohorts) as to risk the annihilation of his own people.</p>

                    Political Memo; G.O.P. Plagued With Democratic Problems                </h2>
                <p class="summary" itemprop="description">When William J. Bennett backed out of his agreement to become chairman of the Republican National Committee he was walking away from one of the biggest headaches in American politics right now. The Republican Party is rife with problems that have long been associated with the Democrats: ideological schisms, personal bickering, pique parading as principle and individual agendas undermining party unity. There is rising concern among Republicans around the country that at a time when the White House should be pulling the party together, the President is distracted by a range of foreign crises and his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, is more concerned with settling grudges with other powerful Republicans. The absence of Lee Atwater, the party chief who is suffering from an inoperable brain tumor, has become glaringly apparent, many Republicans now say. Mr. Sununu has tried to consolidate the jobs of chief of staff and chief political adviser. This would be difficult for even the most light-footed of operatives. But politically minded Republicans say it has created nothing but grief under Mr. Sununu, who walks across political minefields with all the grace of a raging elephant. Friends insist Mr. Bennett was telling the truth when he announced he could not succed Mr. Atwater because his concerns about conflict of interest would keep him from making as much money as he needed. But they also said that he had long discussions with associates about the seriousness of the party's internal divisions, and that this did nothing to encourage him to overcome the financial obstacles. Indeed, officials in Mr. Sununu's office say they offered to more than double the chairman's salary, to $300,000, to entice Mr. Bennett. But that was said to be less than half of what he could make from speaking fees. So he walked away sending a letter of explanation to the President and holding a news conference in the White House driveway that only added to the sense that the Republican camp is in disarray. "I would not characterize it as chaos," said Eddie Mahe, who helped run the Republican National Committee when Mr. Bush was its chairman. "But it surely could be characterized as confusion. There is no shining beacon on any hill that all forces are moving toward. It's just a mumbo jumbo of forces on a plain." Some of the current problem goes to the very core of the party. Two of the bonding agents of the Republican coalition, opposition to communism and opposition to taxes, have been weakened, one as a result of world events and the other as a result of White House handling of the budget negotiations. On top of these philosophical problems, and in several cases because of them, Washington is being treated to a series of Republican feuds of a sort remarkable even by Washington's standards of pigue, backbiting and infighting. Some news from the battlefield: *Two of the party's best known conservatives, Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development who was a Presidential candidate in 1988, and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the minority whip who hopes to be the next Republican leader of the House, openly rebelled against Mr. Bush's decision to raise taxes to get a budget deal with Democrats and are still battling the White House over domestic policy. *Conservatives of various stripes are talking about a challenge to Mr. Bush for the 1992 Presidential nomination. Pete duPont, the former Delaware Governor and another candidate for the Republican nomination in 1988, is setting up a political committee that some conservatives hope will serve as a vehicle for another Presidential campaign. Aides to Mr. duPont say these are pipe dreams of frustrated conservatives. *Mr. Sununu is barely on speaking terms with Mr. Gingrich and, in a seperate feud, has blocked the President from signing fund-raising letters on behalf of the House Republican Campaign Committee so long as Edward J. Rollins, one of the Republican Party's most outspoken political strategists, is in charge. Mr. Rollins's offense was to suggest during the midterm campaigns that Republican candidates should separate themselves from Mr. Bush's flip-flops on taxes. The grumbling on the right has become so loud that one Republican entrepreneur has even carved out a successful market by selling buttons with the message, "Dan Quayle now." So far, most of this is of fascination to a few thousand political insiders. But Republican operatives fear that the confusion is beginning to plant doubts in the public mind about the competence of the President. That would be nothing more than an irritant if the economy, that great mover of public opinion, were headed up. But it is the last thing Mr. Bush needs as the economy heads down, dragging the President's political standing with it. An Old Argument in New Light Mr. Bush took a list of potential party chairmen to Camp David this weekend. But some Republicans say that what may be more important is who he names to run his re-election campaign. That is the person who will probably emerge as chief political adviser and will provide the counterweight to Mr. Sununu that has been missing since Mr. Atwater became ill. Some of what is going on is a battle for control of the domestic policy agenda. "We are in the middle of an argument which a lot of us thought ended in 1989," Mr. Gingrich said. "There really is a fundemental difference between the managerial/accommodationist approach to the welfare state and the reform/replacement approach." Ideological conservatives like Mr. Gingrich would like the White House to champion a program of low taxes, curtailed bureaucracy, freer markets and the use of Federal funds to increase individual choices in areas like education. A White House conservative, Jim Pinkerton, called this program "the new paradigm" for a post-New Deal conservative agenda. That led to an inside battle when the budget director, Richard G. Darman, seemed to make fun of the idea in a recent speech. Mr. Gingrich, a proponent of Mr. Pinkerton's thesis, said Mr. Darman should be dismissed if he did not embrace the effort to forge a new conservative agenda. Mr. Darman and Mr. Gingrich have held about 12 hours of meetings since their blow-up, Mr. Gingrich's staff reports. The mood between the two men is said to be better now, and Mr. Gingrich's camp at least credits Mr. Darman with showing enough respect for the new paradigmists to debate their ideas. But the big test, the conservatives say, will be what Mr. Bush says in his budget and State of the Union Message about domestic policy. Mr. Sununu tried to address some of that in a speech this week, saying that whether it was called the new paradigm or something else the cornerstone of Mr. Bush's domestic policy was the encouragement of capitalism and the expansion of free markets.</p>
