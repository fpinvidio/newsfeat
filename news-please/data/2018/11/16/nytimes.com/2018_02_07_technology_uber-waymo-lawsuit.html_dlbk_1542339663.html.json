Google invested in Uber. The internet giant’s top lawyer even served on Uber’s board of directors.\nBut that “big brother, little brother” relationship deteriorated into paranoia as both companies pursued the creation of autonomous vehicles, Travis Kalanick, Uber’s former chief executive, said on Wednesday.\nIn the second full day of testimony in a federal trial that could last a month, Mr. Kalanick said the ride-hailing service’s acquisition of Otto, a start-up founded by a former Google engineer, had been spurred in part by concern that the search giant would create a rival, robot-powered service.\nWaymo, which filed the lawsuit that is being heard, contends that Uber’s purchase of Otto in August 2016 was part of a plot to collude with former Google engineers to steal the company’s trade secrets.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/technology/uber-waymo-lawsuit.html?dlbk"}
