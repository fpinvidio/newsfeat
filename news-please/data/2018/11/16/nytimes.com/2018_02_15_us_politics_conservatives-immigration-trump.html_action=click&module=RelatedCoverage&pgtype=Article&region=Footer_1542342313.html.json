And at first his plan struck many conservatives as too generous because it would offer 1.8 million young immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children the opportunity to become citizens. But by coupling his offer with demands to sharply reduce legal immigration — a trade-off many Democrats say they cannot accept — then threatening to veto anything that does not meet those demands, the president has made a bipartisan compromise exceedingly difficult.\nThat may have been the point, as it sits just fine with many on the right who never wanted a deal in the first place.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/politics/conservatives-immigration-trump.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
