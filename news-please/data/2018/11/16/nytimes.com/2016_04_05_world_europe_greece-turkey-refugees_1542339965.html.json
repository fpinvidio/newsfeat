Once there, the migrants were taken into tents for processing and then loaded onto buses — to where, Turkish officials would not say.\nAn additional 66 migrants were deported from the island of Chios, where riots broke out last week among asylum seekers fearing deportation. In all, Greek officials said those deported were mostly Pakistanis and Afghans, though they also included two Syrians, who had not asked for asylum, the officials said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/world/europe/greece-turkey-refugees.html"}
