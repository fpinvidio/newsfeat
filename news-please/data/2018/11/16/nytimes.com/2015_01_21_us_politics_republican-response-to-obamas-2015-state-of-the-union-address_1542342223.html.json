So on rainy school days, my mom would slip plastic bread bags over them to keep them dry. But I was never embarrassed, because the school bus would be filled with rows and rows of young Iowans with bread bags slipped over their feet.\nOur parents may not have had much, but they worked hard for what they did have.\nThese days though, many families feel like they’re working harder and harder with less and less to show for it, not just in Red Oak, but across the country.\nWe see our neighbors agonize over stagnant wages and lost jobs. We see the hurt caused by canceled healthcare plans and higher monthly insurance bills. We see too many moms and dads put their own dreams on hold while growing more fearful about the kind of future they’ll be able to leave to their children.\nAmericans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like “Obamacare.” It’s a mindset that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions.\nThat’s why the new Republican majority you elected started by reforming Congress to make it function again. And now, we’re working hard to pass the kind of serious job-creation ideas you deserve.\nOne you’ve probably heard about is the Keystone jobs bill. President Obama has been delaying this bipartisan infrastructure project for years, even though many members of his party, unions, and a strong majority of Americans support it. the president’s own State Department has said Keystone’s construction could support thousands of jobs and pump billions into our economy, and do it with minimal environmental impact.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/politics/republican-response-to-obamas-2015-state-of-the-union-address.html"}
