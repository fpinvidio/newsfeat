Of these, 868 said they were registered to vote.\nSSRS of Media, Pa., conducted sampling, interviewing and tabulation for the survey. Interviews were in English or Spanish.\nThe sample of landline telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 81,000 active residential exchanges across the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to ensure that each region of the country was represented in its proper proportion.\nWithin each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each landline household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/us/politics/how-the-new-york-times-cbs-news-poll-was-conducted.html?module=inline"}
