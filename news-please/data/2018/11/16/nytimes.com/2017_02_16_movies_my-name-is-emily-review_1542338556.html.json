Yet thanks to beautifully warm performances and Seamus Deasy’s easy-on-the-eyes cinematography, this slight first feature from Simon Fitzmaurice (who is paralyzed by the motor neuron disease A.L.S.) might just charm you into submission.\nWistful flashbacks and a self-aware narration fill us in on Emily (Evanna Lynch), 16, an outsider as much in her foster home as in her Dublin school. Her mother is dead and her eccentric father, Robert (the great Michael Smiley), is in a rural mental hospital — at least until Emily and her only friend, Arden (George Webster), arrive to break him out.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/movies/my-name-is-emily-review.html"}
