But as sea ice retreats during Arctic summers, walruses are being driven ashore.</p><div id="g-audio"></div><p>“In the summer we’ve seen the sea ice recede far to the north,” said Chadwick V. Jay, a research ecologist for the United States Geological Survey. That change is “making it very difficult for walruses to make a living.”</p><p>In five of the last seven summers, tens of thousands of female Pacific walruses and their pups have come ashore in Alaska, farther from their preferred prey: the clam, worm and snail beds in the deep waters of the Bering and Chukchi Seas.</p></div>

      <h2 class="g-c-hed">Coral Algae</h2>
      <div class="g-c-text"><p>Coralline algae are the cement that binds many reefs together. By filling the gaps between corals with a hard outer shell, these algae fortify the reef and provide shelter for growing organisms.</p><p>To produce that shell, this special algae &#8212; much like oysters and snails &#8212; require a steady supply of carbonate. But as carbonate becomes harder and harder to come by in increasingly acid oceans, the once-dominant species of coralline algae can no longer grow shells as thick as they once were. Other species are moving in to claim more territory.</p><p>For now, it might not be so bad to give these competitors a chance, said Sophie McCoy, an ecologist with the Plymouth Marine Laboratory in England, who lead a<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12247/abstract;jsessionid=BA1A704F1BF30A6D4528F3A00F3CB6BF.f02t03"> study</a> on the phenomenon when she was at the University of Chicago earlier this year.</p><p>&ldquo;In the short term, I think it might be a good thing in terms of local biodiversity,&rdquo; she said. In the long run, however, “all the species of this algae will start to be affected.&rdquo; </p><p>That could mean less coral overall, and less habitat for the organisms that call it home. </p></div>
