    <p class="intro desktop-intro">The libertarian-leaning junior senator from Kentucky is trying to shape his own political identity. Most of the influential members of his team have little or no connection to his father, Ron Paul, a former Texas congressman who twice sought the Republican presidential nomination. <a href="#doug-stafford">Doug Stafford</a> is the senator’s closest political adviser. The campaign manager, <a href="#chip-englander">Chip Englander</a>, ran Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner’s 2014 campaign. <a href="#vincent-harris">Vincent Harris</a>, a GOP digital star, was poached from Ted Cruz’s camp. And strategists <a href="#mike-biundo">Mike Biundo</a> and <a href="#john-yob">John Yob</a> learned the arcane world of delegate math while working for Rick Santorum in 2012. Advisers with connections to both Pauls are running <a href="#paulsuperpac">America’s Liberty PAC</a>, the super PAC supporting Rand’s campaign.</p>
