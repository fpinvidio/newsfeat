That dysfunction has hobbled the country, leaving it one of the poorest on the European continent and often beholden to the whims of Russia.\nSo the question always lingers over a Kiev government that its citizens have learned to regard as guilty until proven innocent: Will that poisonous legacy come back to snuff out the ideals of Maidan, where hundreds of thousands protested last winter — and scores died — demanding a European future?\nIt certainly cast a shadow this week as Ukrainian voters choosing a new Parliament made clear that they wanted President Petro O. Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk to work together to pursue a pro-European course.\nAlthough the two men have been allies since the outbreak of mass street protests in Kiev last year, the election also revealed the fault lines of a tense, new rivalry like those that proved so debilitating in the past: between President Viktor A. Yushchenko and his prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko; between Mr. Yushchenko and another prime minister and former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych; and between Mr. Yanukovych and Ms. Tymoshenko, whom he imprisoned.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/world/europe/after-ukraine-vote-a-new-test-burying-a-legacy-of-dysfunctional-politics.html"}
