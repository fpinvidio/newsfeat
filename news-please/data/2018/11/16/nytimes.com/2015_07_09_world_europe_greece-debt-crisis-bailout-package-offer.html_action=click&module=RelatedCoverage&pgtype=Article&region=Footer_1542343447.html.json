Greece must pay back €3.5 billion to the European Central Bank by July 20. That seems highly unlikely.\nWhy can’t Greece make these debt payments?\nGreece is about to run out of money, and Europe has said it will not lend money to the Greek government, or the country’s banks, until it changes its ways. When Greece runs out of money, and cannot borrow any more, it will not be able to honor its debts, pay pensions or finance services.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/world/europe/greece-debt-crisis-bailout-package-offer.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
