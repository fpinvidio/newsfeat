The jury was also expected to hear opening statements by a prosecutor and Mr. Ullahâ€™s lawyer.\n[Before he tried to bomb the subway, Akayed Ullah visited a Rohingya refugee camp in his native Bangladesh. Why?]\nThe trial comes at a moment of high tension in the country, just days after pipe bombs were mailed to prominent Democrats and opponents of President Trump, and a gunman killed 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/nyregion/new-york-news-ullah-subway-bombing-trial.html"}
