I just wore it in Hawaii.”\nShe had placed her own stamp on Ms. Kamali’s wrap-and-tie jersey, twisting and tweaking it to suit her shape. “I’ve been buying Kamali since my teens,” Ms. Craig, 47, said.\nShe was one in a crowd of Kamali enthusiasts, women of varying ages and shapes, draped from shoulder to shinbone in the designer’s golden oldies. Showing off Ms. Kamali’s much-mythologized sleeping bag coats, ruched parachute dresses or fringed-and-feathered evening clothes, they had gathered at What Goes Around Comes Around, the fancy secondhand shop on West Broadway in SoHo, to commemorate the designer’s half-century in business.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/fashion/rediscovering-norma-kamali-again.html"}
