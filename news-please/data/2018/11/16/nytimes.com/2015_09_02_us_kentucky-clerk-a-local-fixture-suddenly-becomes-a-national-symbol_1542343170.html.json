Her mother had been the Rowan County clerk for 37 years, and when she announced her retirement, Ms. Davis, who had worked in the office for much of that time, ran successfully as a Democrat to succeed her. A Republican candidate lodged an accusation of nepotism, to no avail.\nShe knew her clients, and their stories. If she knew a family member was sick, or feeble with age, or in trouble with the law, she would ask after that person while conducting county business. She would often offer her prayers.\nIt was not a job likely to lead to notoriety, but after she defied court orders to issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples, there she was Tuesday, hailed and berated by placard-wielding strangers outside Rowan County’s tidy, six-columned courthouse. Some had taken to the Internet to praise her for her stand. Others excoriated her, accusing her of hypocrisy and citing her family history, which includes four marriages — two to her current husband.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/us/kentucky-clerk-a-local-fixture-suddenly-becomes-a-national-symbol.html"}
