It features striking visual elements: images of thousands of Latin American men, women and children in a procession so large it sometimes fills the width of a city street. Though reports often suggest that the migrants are headed to the United States to declare asylum, many remain in Mexico.\nThe migrants cite various reasons for their journey. Some say they are fleeing gangs that terrorize their neighborhoods. Others cite searching for work and more stability for their families. Advocacy groups have, in the past, used caravans to draw attention to the desperate situation in countries like Honduras and push the United States to relax its immigration laws.\nCoverage of the caravan has become a vehicle for other conspiratorial story lines that are popular on the right. Sometimes they spread with the help of the president.\nLast week, for example, Mr. Trump posted video of a large crowd of Spanish-speaking people in lines being handed cash — presumably the payments he was referring to in Montana.\n“Can you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?” the president said on Twitter.\nBut before Mr. Trump sent out his tweet, Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who is an outspoken ally of the president’s, circulated the video, hinting that it revealed a Democratic plot funded by George Soros, the billionaire progressive philanthropist and donor, to overrun the country with immigrants weeks before the elections. In right-wing media outlets, Mr. Soros is often the caravan’s hidden architect. There is no evidence he has played any role in financing the caravans.\nMost Republicans are not unhappy with legal immigration, polling shows. An independent Grinnell College survey conducted in late August and early September found that just 21 percent of Republicans said the country had too many legal immigrants, compared with 12 percent of Democrats.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/trump-migrant-caravan-midterm.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
