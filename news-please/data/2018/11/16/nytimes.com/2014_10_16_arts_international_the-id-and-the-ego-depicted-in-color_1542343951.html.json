In an installation he created in 2010 for the Kunstnernes Hus in Oslo, he placed objects of art in two rooms, each presided over by a hanging traffic light: one set to green, the other to red.\n“They were loosely based around the unconscious and the conscious,” he said. “The red was holding something at rest for examination, and the green was this constant ebb and flow of things in motion.”\nMr. Wallinger had been looking for a concept that would help him curate an exhibition at the Frieze London art fair for Hauser & Wirth, the gallery he joined last spring.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/arts/international/the-id-and-the-ego-depicted-in-color.html"}
