This is just my third or fourth attempt at this style of puzzle and I think I’ve got the knack, or at least a consistent approach.\nI now work the rows first thing. Since they each have two clues, you can deduce where to enter any answers you’re sure of. So I threw in GERMAN, TENURE, FALLEN and NINETY, ELEVEN PM and “on sale” (whoops! I mean OR LESS) with some confidence, making the bands around a bit easier to piece together.\nAny thing I encounter in life (in the puzzle environs and beyond) that references MARY TYLER MOORE is a winner in my book. Her full name hasn’t been in the Times grid yet, according to xwordinfo.com — she’d be such a joyous seed entry for an odd-shaped puzzle (or a Sunday). I also absolutely loved the back and forth overlap of CANAPE and PANACHE, MELTY and WHEAT GERM. The only entry I thought was iffy was AGE LEVEL, but the rest was pure gold.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/crosswords/variety-marching-bands.html"}
