''The world is watching this experiment closely.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="73" data-total-count="2356">The ceremony in October was the culmination of an unusually sharp debate.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="419" data-total-count="2775">Environmentalists and human rights and antiglobalization activists have opposed the pipeline because it cuts through politically sensitive tribal lands, and they focused their ire on the World Bank. In the Clinton administration, officials at the State and Commerce Departments backed the plan, pitting them against their counterparts at the Agency for International Development and the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="133" data-total-count="2908">Now a deep suspicion remains among Chadians, leveled not only at their government and the oil consortium, but also at the World Bank.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="191" data-total-count="3099">Though the pipeline represents the World Bank's single largest investment in sub-Saharan Africa, the bank's $200 million in loans to the governments of Chad and Cameroon are relatively small.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="109" data-total-count="3208">More important is the bank's moral backing, without which the oil companies might have abandoned the project.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="307" data-total-count="3515">''The World Bank has invested a lot of its credibility in this project, and so if it fails in Chad, it will have to find another development formula,'' said Soumaine Adoum, a Chadian who is the representative for SuisseAide, a private Swiss organization.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="255" data-total-count="3770" id="story-continues-4">At its peak, according to early estimates, Chad will pump about 225,000 barrels a day of oil and earn more than $125 million a year at current oil prices. Whatever the figure, the money will have a huge impact on Chad's tiny yearly budget of $230 million.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="246" data-total-count="4016">Over the next quarter of a century, more than $2 billion is expected to fill Chad's coffers -- small change by Western standards, but an unfathomable sum for a country where 80 percent of the eight million people live on less than a dollar a day.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="276" data-total-count="4292">Based on experience in the developing world, Chad could well expect those millions to create a tiny yet extremely wealthy circle of business and political power brokers, while the remaining 95 percent of Chad's citizens would find their lot no better, and possibly even worse.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="376" data-total-count="4668">They might see oil money diverted to almost anything but the public good, from monumental, white-elephant projects like the re-routing of rivers to fighting civil wars. The initial signs in Chad have not been promising. Last year, President Idriss Déby secretly used the first chunk of oil money -- $4.5 million -- to buy weapons to use against rebels in the northern desert.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="4875">Chad holds a presidential election on May 20, pitting Mr. Déby against six other candidates. While the vote is likely to go to a second round, Mr. Déby is the clear favorite to win a second five-year term.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="438" data-total-count="5313">''Oil is the devil's gold,'' said Leonidas Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies, a London consulting firm, ''because when you have a commodity selling at a price that is around four times its cost of production, it is easy money, like winning the lottery. It's just human nature. If you haven't had to work hard for your money, you tend to underestimate its value. And countries are no different than people.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="249" data-total-count="5562">That is not to say that oil is a universal curse. Countries like Norway or Britain, which had developed economies and political systems long before oil flowed from the North Sea, were capable of absorbing, managing and benefiting from their bonanza.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="5800">But now most of the world's largest oil deposits lie under poor countries with little political accountability. The United States has only 2 percent of the world's proven reserves, and North Sea production, after a long run, is declining.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

In that time Chad's largest industry, cotton, grew ever more unproductive. Lake Chad, the largest body of water, shrank by 90 percent because of the advancing Sahara. Chad essentially became a ward of France and the United States.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="242" data-total-count="7481">Only about 250 miles of road are paved.

They point out that the government of President Déby is really a cabal of his ethnic group, the Zaghawa, which fought a devastating civil war to grab power a decade ago, and not a real government with the checks and balances to manage a budget, much less an oil windfall.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="312" data-total-count="11363">Corruption is everywhere. On the streets of N'Djamena and in the southern cities, gasoline stations stand deserted. Gas is smuggled into the black market -- clearly with the complicity of the authorities.

Today Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil producer and has about $30 billion in debt. Access to oil and its revenues remains in the grip of an elite.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="260" data-total-count="13235">''Normal business in places like Nigeria went to hell in a handbasket,'' said one Western oil executive. ''Why grow food yourself when you can buy it? Why be a farmer when you can be a well-paid civil servant? Parts of the economy shrank and never recovered.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="233" data-total-count="13468">The problems multiply when oil prices fall. With little else in their economies, oil revenues shrink drastically when world petroleum prices slip.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="183" data-total-count="13941" id="story-continues-9">Therein lies one of the major problems: the money flows from the top down, making accountability difficult. In fact, many oil-producing states do not even disclose how much they earn.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="14178">''The governments are not reliant on taxpayers for income,'' said Arvind Ganesan, director of business and human rights at the New York-based Human Rights Watch. ''They get their wealth from elsewhere, and the political link is broken.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="345" data-total-count="14523">At the peak of construction, the pipeline project from Chad will employ about 7,000 people, but that will be for only a brief period, and most of the skilled workers will be foreigners, according to ExxonMobil. When fully functioning, the consortium will employ between 500 and 800, and it hopes that over time 80 percent of them will be locals.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="451" data-total-count="14974">In Chad, the World Bank endorsed the pipeline project after the government agreed to strict rules for the control and use of oil revenues. For example, under a new law, Chad is to reserve about 80 percent of its oil revenues for education, health, social services, rural development and infrastructure. Another 10 percent is to be kept in a trust. The rest is to be assigned to develop the oil-producing region or to be at the government's discretion.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="15320">What is more, the government agreed to what bank officials describe as an unusual check on spending: a so-called Oil Revenues Control and Monitoring Board. The group -- nine members from government, human rights, labor and other organizations -- will oversee the spending of oil revenues, authorizing or vetoing plans submitted by the government.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="158" data-total-count="15478">But critics say only three or four of the nine members are truly independent. One of them is Michel Barka, an official with the country's largest labor group.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="311" data-total-count="15789">''Eventually, they will try to manipulate the board the same way they manipulate many groups in civil society,'' Mr. Barka said. ''They'll put obstacles in our way. They'll say, 'Here, Michel, here's 15 million francs, look the other way.' That's the way they operate -- and unfortunately it works very often.''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="16019">An adviser to the president, who is of a different ethnic group, said he believed that Mr. Déby was genuinely committed to improving the lives of Chadians, but that he may not succeed in Africa's winner-take-all political system.</p><div id="story-ad-8" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

''Will they change their behavior now? Now that they are finally going to see the oil they have been waiting for all these years?''</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="16647">Still, international lenders like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank wield considerable power over oil-exporting countries. They can encourage change as a condition for loans or for restructuring old debt.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="203" data-total-count="16850">The World Bank is training the Chadian government to develop long-term strategies, to master the number-crunching to determine allocations and to set up a system to disburse the money and verify its use.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="226" data-total-count="17076">And at the bank's urging, Parliament adopted a law stipulating that all oil revenues first be put into foreign escrow accounts, so the World Bank and Chadians themselves could see exactly how much money the state is receiving.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="215" data-total-count="17291">The pipeline's supporters say the money from oil will help pave roads, making it easier for farmers to export their goods. With the help of the World Bank, Chad plans to privatize its cotton industry in a few years.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="229" data-total-count="17520">In N'Djamena, the country's very small group of business executives remains skeptical, saying the government has done nothing so far but talk. Many have complained that Chadians have benefited little, if at all, from the project.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="278" data-total-count="17798">Oil consortium officials have set up unreasonably strict criteria to eliminate local bidders, executives complain. And the government -- instead of helping local businesses by, for instance, making loans available -- has looked away, interested only in getting the oil revenues.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="195" data-total-count="17993">Boukhary B. Doudou, whose family-owned business, one of Chad's biggest, is involved in real estate, transportation, agricultural exports and other activities, said he had yet to win a single bid.</p><div id="story-ad-9" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

So have impatience and despair, prostitution and thievery, drunkenness and fighting, ills that have grown so prevalent that some have begun a bit of cynical word play, calling the village Satan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="18797">Inside one straw hut that doubles as an evangelical church and clinic, Thomas Laoudion, 45, described himself as a nurse and a preacher. He wanted to drop the S sound from the village's name and call it simply Attend -- to wait, not only for work, the preacher explained, but also for the Second Coming.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="112" data-total-count="18909">Congolese music wafted cheerfully from two bar huts, effacing somehow the gloom cast by this Beckettian waiting.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="89" data-total-count="18998">''We are waiting for our oil,'' the preacher said, ''and we are waiting for our Savior.''</p><aside class="story-content subscriptions-module hidden" id="subscriptions-module"></aside><footer class="story-footer story-content">
