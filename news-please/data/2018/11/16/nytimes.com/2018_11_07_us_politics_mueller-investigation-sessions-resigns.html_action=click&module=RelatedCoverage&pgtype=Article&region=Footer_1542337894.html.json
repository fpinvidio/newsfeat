It said that the attorney general may remove the special counsel only for cause, like misconduct of some kind, rather than at will.\nMr. Whitaker could decide that Mr. Mueller has committed misconduct and fire him, or he could revoke the protections that the regulation provides to Mr. Mueller and then fire him without cause.\nCan Mr. Whitaker quash a Mueller report?\nWhen Mr. Mueller completes his work, he is to deliver a report about his findings to the attorney general, according to the regulation. It would then be up to the attorney general — now Mr. Whitaker — to decide whether to turn that document over to Congress or keep it secret.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/mueller-investigation-sessions-resigns.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
