<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="429" data-total-count="429">With Albany rocked by a seemingly endless barrage of scandals and arrests, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo set up <a href="http://nyti.ms/1ncR5HK">a high-powered commission</a> last summer to root out corruption in state politics. It was barely two months old when its investigators, hunting for violations of campaign-finance laws, issued a subpoena to a media-buying firm that had placed millions of dollars’ worth of advertisements for the New York State Democratic Party.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="180" data-total-count="609">The investigators did not realize that the firm, Buying Time, also counted Mr. Cuomo among its clients, having bought the airtime for his campaign when he ran for governor in 2010.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="220" data-total-count="829">Word that the subpoena had been served quickly reached Mr. Cuomo’s most senior aide, <a href="http://nyti.ms/1u95CcV">Lawrence S. Schwartz</a>. He called one of the commission’s three co-chairs, William J. Fitzpatrick, the district attorney in Syracuse.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="228" data-total-count="1057">“This is wrong,” Mr. Schwartz said, according to Mr. Fitzpatrick, whose account was corroborated by three other people told about the call at the time. He said the firm worked for the governor, and issued a simple directive:</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="19" data-total-count="1076">“Pull it back.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="143" data-total-count="1219">The subpoena was swiftly withdrawn. The panel’s chief investigator explained why in an email to the two other co-chairs later that afternoon.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="294" data-total-count="1788" id="story-continues-3">While the governor now maintains he had every right to monitor and direct the work of a commission he had created, many commissioners and investigators saw the demands as politically motivated interference that hamstrung an undertaking that the governor had publicly vowed would be independent.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="341" data-total-count="2129">The commission developed a list of promising targets, including a lawmaker suspected of using campaign funds to support a girlfriend in another state and pay tanning-salon bills. The panel also highlighted activities that it saw as politically odious but perfectly legal, like exploiting a loophole to bundle enormous campaign contributions.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="247" data-total-count="2376">But a three-month examination by The New York Times found that the governor’s office deeply compromised the panel’s work, objecting whenever the commission focused on groups with ties to Mr. Cuomo or on issues that might reflect poorly on him.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="332" data-total-count="2708">Ultimately, Mr. Cuomo abruptly <a href="http://nyti.ms/1zYQ5ww">disbanded the commission</a> halfway through what he had indicated would be an 18-month life. And now, as the Democratic governor seeks a second term in November, federal prosecutors are investigating the roles of Mr. Cuomo and his aides in the panel’s shutdown and are pursuing its unfinished business.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="757" data-total-count="3465">Before its demise, Mr. Cuomo’s aides repeatedly pressured the commission, many of whose members and staff thought they had been given a once-in-a-career chance at cleaning up Albany. As a result, the panel’s brief existence — and the writing and editing of its sole creation, a report of its preliminary findings — was marred by infighting, arguments and accusations. Things got so bad that investigators believed a Cuomo appointee was monitoring their communications without their knowledge. Resignations further crippled the commission. In the end, the governor got the Legislature to agree to a package of ethics reforms far less ambitious than those the commission had recommended — a result Mr. Cuomo hailed as proof of the panel’s success.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="319" data-total-count="3784">While some reports of tension between the governor’s office and the commission surfaced in the news media at the time, the examination by The Times provides the first full accounting of how extensively the governor’s aides involved themselves in the commission’s work and the level of disruption that this caused.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="4098">The examination included a review of hundreds of emails, subpoenas and internal documents and interviews with more than three dozen commission members, employees, legislative staff members and other officials. Few of those interviewed agreed to be quoted by name for fear of antagonizing the governor or his aides.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="344" data-total-count="4442" id="story-continues-4">Mr. Cuomo said early on that the commission would be “totally independent” and free to pursue wrongdoing anywhere in state government, including in his own office. “Anything they want to look at, they can look at — me, the lieutenant governor, the attorney general, the comptroller, any senator, any assemblyman,” he said last August.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="253" data-total-count="4695">In a 13-page statement responding to The Times’s questions, Mr. Cuomo’s office defended its handling of the commission. It said the commission was created by and reported to the governor, and therefore he could not be accused of interfering with it.</p> <figure id="23moreland-governor-response" class="interactive promo  layout-small">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="4900">While he allowed the commission the independence to investigate whatever it wanted, the governor’s office said, it would have been a conflict for a panel he created to investigate his own administration.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="189" data-total-count="5089">“A commission appointed by and staffed by the executive cannot investigate the executive,” the statement said. “It is a pure conflict of interest and would not pass the laugh test.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="5308">Yet, The Times found that the governor’s office interfered with the commission when it was looking into groups that were politically close to him. In fact, the commission never tried to investigate his administration.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="607" data-total-count="5915">Beyond that, Mr. Cuomo’s office said, the commission needed the governor’s guiding hand because it was, simply, a mess: Its staff was plagued by “relationship issues” and was “mired in discord.” The commissioners, whom he earlier called some of New York’s sharpest governmental and legal minds, “did not understand the budget or legislative process or how state government worked,” the statement said. Their subpoenas often had “no logic or basis,” and those that touched on the governor’s supporters were more for show than for legitimate investigative purposes, the statement said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="377" data-total-count="6292">At the center of the battle between independent-minded commissioners and Mr. Cuomo and his aides were two hard-charging lawyers: E. Danya Perry, a former federal prosecutor who was the panel’s chief of investigations; and Regina M. Calcaterra, a former securities lawyer who, as the commission’s executive director, routinely conveyed the wishes of the governor’s office.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="133" data-total-count="6425">Working closely with Ms. Calcaterra was Mr. Schwartz, the secretary to the governor, a job far more powerful than the title suggests.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

What became of the commission left many of them disillusioned.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="396" data-total-count="8166">“The thing that bothered me the most is we were created with all this fanfare and the governor was going to clean up Albany,” said Barbara Bartoletti, legislative director for the League of Women Voters of New York State and a special adviser to the commission. “And it became purely a vehicle for the governor to get legislation.

But by early last year, the parade of handcuffed officials had not subsided. In little more than a month, three state legislators were arrested on federal charges; one of them was <a href="http://nyti.ms/1nONICH">accused of trying to bribe his way</a> onto the New York City mayoral ballot, and another had <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/14/nyregion/assemblyman-from-the-south-bronx-is-convicted-on-bribery-and-extortion-charges.html">sold legislation for cash</a>.</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

With him were Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman and district attorneys from across the state.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="9183">Mr. Cuomo said the rash of scandals had shaken the public’s confidence, and he announced he was creating a formidable new commission, investing it with subpoena power and giving it until the end of 2014 to crack down on public corruption as never before.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="165" data-total-count="9348">It was called a Moreland Commission, after a 1907 law that governors had long used to create panels to investigate wrongdoing and recommend legislative improvements.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="75" data-total-count="9423">“The people of this state should sleep better tonight,” Mr. Cuomo said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="313" data-total-count="9736">Three people would lead the panel, formally named the Commission to Investigate Public Corruption. The governor selected two: the affable and blunt-spoken Mr. Fitzpatrick, the longtime district attorney in Onondaga County and a Republican; and Kathleen M. Rice, the Nassau County district attorney and a Democrat.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="10061">Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, recommended nine of the 25 members, including the third leader: Milton L.

A unanimous vote of the commission’s three leaders would be required to issue a subpoena.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="132" data-total-count="10193">“I believe, with the credibility of this commission, you can go a long way towards restoring that public trust,” Mr. Cuomo said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="248" data-total-count="10441">The members included prosecutors, professors and lawyers, some with close ties to Mr. Cuomo.

In their cross hairs from the outset were the pots of money that had long spawned scandals in the Legislature: campaign donations and spending; the easy-to-abuse expense reimbursements known as <a href="http://nyti.ms/Ur1rsi">per diem payments</a>; and the outside income that some lawmakers earned in lucrative part-time jobs, often at law firms representing clients with business before the state.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="11831">A consulting firm, K2 Intelligence, was hired to search databases for donations linked to the passage of legislation or to the awarding of state contracts.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="12087">But as investigators asked questions, they found themselves inquiring about matters related to the governor’s supporters.

She had led Mr. Cuomo’s first Moreland panel, which dug into utility companies’ responses to Hurricane Sandy. (She had also written a memoir about her troubled childhood, which prompted a New York Post headline: “I Was Homeless — Now I’m Fabulous.”)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="233" data-total-count="12954">One of the first roadblocks Ms. Perry and her investigators encountered came when they sought to subpoena the Real Estate Board of New York, a powerful trade group whose members have been among Mr. Cuomo’s most generous supporters.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="273" data-total-count="13227">According to a subpoena that had been prepared, investigators wanted to examine the real estate board’s political donations, its materials related to a valuable tax break for new housing, and its communications with public officials, including phone calls with lawmakers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="225" data-total-count="13452">Ms. Calcaterra repeatedly pressed Ms. Perry not to serve the subpoena, emails show. Yet the commission backed Ms. Perry, and on Aug. 19, she wrote to the co-chairs that she would be sharing a subpoena with them “shortly.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="58" data-total-count="13510">Whereupon Mr. Cuomo’s office stepped in to shut it down.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="214" data-total-count="13724">Mr. Schwartz, the secretary to the governor, telephoned one of the commission’s three leaders in a fury, according to four people briefed on the call. There would be no subpoena to the real estate board, he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="129" data-total-count="13853">Ultimately, the commission merely sent the real estate board a letter asking it to provide information voluntarily, which it did.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="14192"><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1225400-secretary-of-the-governors-response-to-questions.html">In a statement</a>, Mr. Schwartz, who is not a lawyer, did not address specific subpoenas but generally acknowledged giving the commission “advice on investigative or tactical decisions,” but only to improve its “effectiveness and fairness.” He added that he often said that investigative decisions were ultimately up to the co-chairs.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="152" data-total-count="14344">Around the same time, commission investigators also decided to subpoena a major retailer to see if its donations were linked to passage of a tax credit.</p><div id="story-ad-7" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent ">

The tax credit had been included in Mr. Cuomo’s budget, she told Ms. Perry, so any questions raised about it could reflect poorly on him, according to several people apprised of the exchange.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="349" data-total-count="14956">On Aug. 28, Ms. Perry forwarded an email chain about the resistance to Ms. Rice, the panel’s co-chairwoman, who sent it along to the other two. “Danya can’t be prevented from doing the most basic and noncontroversial aspects of her job,” Ms. Rice wrote. “Thoughts??” (Ms. Rice, through a spokesman, declined to comment for this article.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="328" data-total-count="15284">Mr. Fitzpatrick was exasperated. “The 2d Floor (Larry) needs to understand this is an INDEPENDENT commission and needs to be treated as such,” he wrote, referring to Mr. Schwartz and to the location of the governor’s office in the Capitol. He added that “everything we discuss does not need to be fed back to Floor 2.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="164" data-total-count="15448">“I am not wasting 15 months of my quickly shortening life to write some silly report that Lewis and Clark couldn’t find in five years!” Mr. Fitzpatrick wrote.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="276" data-total-count="15724">Publicly, though, Mr. Fitzpatrick betrayed no sign of the turmoil in the commission and said a number of times that the governor’s office had not interfered — and his seemingly contradictory positions became a source of growing frustration to staff and commission members.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="8" data-total-count="15732"><strong>Uprising</strong></p><figure id="moreland-players-3" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-sub-medium">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="65" data-total-count="29501" id="story-continues-19">In the end, the author was handpicked by the governor’s office.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="161" data-total-count="29662">The resistance was particularly overwhelming when the commission tried to include information that the governor’s aides said could reflect poorly on Mr. Cuomo.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="164" data-total-count="29826">Ms. Perry was adamant that the preliminary report cover what investigators had learned about the powerful Real Estate Board of New York and its political donations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="180" data-total-count="30006">Documents unearthed by investigators included an unusually direct memorandum sent by <a href="http://nyti.ms/1pxa4LK">Steven Spinola</a>, the organization’s president, asking members to donate to Assembly Democrats.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="323" data-total-count="30329">“I can tell you that in private meetings with the speaker, the Senate majority leader and the governor, our past efforts to maintain a personal and supportive relationship was critical in shaping the outcome” of legislation, Mr. Spinola wrote, according to an email from Ms. Perry to the co-chairs that quoted the memo.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="214" data-total-count="30543">“Our future ability to adopt favorable legislation, stop terrible legislation or modify legislation to limit the pain to our industry is directly tied to our continued positive relationship,” Mr. Spinola added.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="206" data-total-count="30749">In her email, Ms. Perry described Mr. Spinola’s memo as “explicitly stating the obvious point that a ‘supportive relationship’ (i.e., the contribution of money) yields legislative ‘outcome.’ ”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="91" data-total-count="30840">“This is exactly a key point of our report and, I think, should be included,” she said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="373" data-total-count="31213">Ms. Perry also wanted the report to highlight her team’s discovery of email correspondence from a major New York City builder, Extell Development, about a coming fund-raiser for Mr. Cuomo tied to his birthday. The email discussed what amounted to a perfectly legal sidestepping of campaign-donation limits: funneling money through a series of limited-liability companies.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="193" data-total-count="31406">“As you know,” Ms. Perry wrote, “I strongly believe we should include whichever docs we think will add the most value in the report and include them without fear or favor, as they say.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="168" data-total-count="31574">The report did recommend closing the limited-liability company loophole. But it omitted any mention of the real estate board, the governor’s birthday party or Extell.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="483" data-total-count="32057">Another section addressed independent groups that had become big political spenders while sometimes keeping their donors’ identities secret. Mr. Cuomo’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1212602-moreland-commission-executive-order.html">executive order</a> creating the commission had directed it to examine the activities of such groups. Yet the biggest lobbying spender in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/nyregion/group-allied-with-cuomo-tops-albany-spending-list.html">2011</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/nyregion/committee-to-save-new-york-tops-2012-list-of-lobbying-spenders.html">2012</a> was one that was created to support the governor’s own agenda: the Committee to Save New York, which spent more than $16 million and did not disclose where its money came from.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="95" data-total-count="32152">Mr. Schwartz had urged the co-chairs early on to steer clear of the Committee to Save New York.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="194" data-total-count="32346">“Larry made clear to me that he was concerned about the perception of subpoenas going to that entity so closely affiliated with the governor,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said in his email to The Times.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="229" data-total-count="32575">Mr. Fitzpatrick said he argued the opposite to Mr. Schwartz: that to avoid looking at entities related to Mr. Cuomo “would be bad for the governor in the eyes of the public.” He added, “We simply disagreed on that point.”</p> <figure id="21moreland-savenewyork" class="interactive promo  layout-small">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="32797">Still, Ms. Perry made sure that the Cuomo-friendly group was mentioned in drafts of the report. In the final product, however, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1223421-savenewyork.html">it was gone — deleted by Ms. Calcaterra</a>, according to a marked-up page obtained by The Times.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="78" data-total-count="32875">A section on campaign-finance reform became the report’s final battleground.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="349" data-total-count="33224">Many commissioners wanted the report to embrace the use of public matching funds for political campaigns — a system they saw as vital to curbing the influence of big donors, and one that the governor had publicly supported but never expended much political capital on. But Ms. Calcaterra sought to play down the idea, people who spoke to her said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="188" data-total-count="33412">When proponents successfully pushed to give it more prominent play in the report, other commissioners, including some of Mr. Cuomo’s most loyal appointees, insisted on writing a dissent.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="245" data-total-count="33657">The dissenters argued that matching funds would accomplish little, given the recent deluge of spending by outside political groups, and that the commission had found no “persuasive evidence” that public financing would discourage corruption.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="44" data-total-count="33701">The debate focused increasingly on minutiae.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="199" data-total-count="33900">On the morning of Dec. 2, the day the report was to be released, the dissenters pressed to have the report state that only a “majority” of commissioners recommended public financing of campaigns.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="159" data-total-count="34059">They were overruled because supporters believed that using the word was meant to highlight the lack of unanimity and help opponents scuttle the recommendation.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="181" data-total-count="34240">At 5:52 p.m., the co-chairs received the latest draft of the report. Before they approved it, copies were sent to the news media — with the word “majority” inserted after all.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="125" data-total-count="34365">Mr. Williams raced upstairs in the commission’s offices to confront Ms. Calcaterra. She called it an unintentional mistake.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="77" data-total-count="34442">“You better fix it now,” he snapped, according to a person who was there.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="37" data-total-count="34479">Ms. Calcaterra assured him she would.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="34698">But that evening, commission staff members toasting the report’s release at a nearby bar heard Mr. Williams yelling into his cellphone at Ms. Calcaterra. He was still demanding that the word “majority” be deleted.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="76" data-total-count="34774">“I am not backing down,” he shouted. “You cannot operate like this.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="92" data-total-count="34866">Sometime that night, the report was quietly rereleased, with the offending language excised.</p> <figure id="23moreland-commission-and-new-york-political-scandals" class="interactive promo  layout-large">

Mr. Cuomo announced a budget deal with lawmakers that included some modest improvements in state ethics laws — strengthening bribery and corruption statutes and enhancing election-law enforcement.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="37060">Only when a reporter asked did Mr. Cuomo address the fate of the Moreland Commission and its more ambitious mission. The governor said he had achieved his goal of a deal on legislation, so the panel would be shut down.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="170" data-total-count="37230">Ms. Calcaterra exulted: On a conference call with staff members, a participant recalled, she checked off the ethics-reform measures, and asked, “Are you doing shots?”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="37451">But Mr. Bharara, the United States attorney, was deeply troubled. In his testimony at the commission’s public hearing in September, he had encouraged it to act aggressively, stand tough and safeguard their independence.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="82" data-total-count="37533">Now, some Moreland officials were concerned their work could wind up in the trash.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="140" data-total-count="37673">On April 9, Mr. Bharara and the head of his public-corruption unit met with the two remaining co-chairmen, Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Williams.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="371" data-total-count="38044">Mr. Bharara was “laser-locked on the shenanigans from the second floor,” one attendee said. The prosecutor noted that the commission had been formed in response to the series of cases his office had brought against lawmakers — and observed how ironic it was that he was now looking into whether the governor had shut down investigations out of political expediency.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="144" data-total-count="38188">The next morning, in an appearance on WNYC radio, Mr. Bharara <a href="http://nyti.ms/Wz2Yyo">assailed the governor</a> for shutting down the panel. It was an extraordinary rebuke.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="232" data-total-count="38420">Even as Mr. Bharara spoke, he said, his investigators were on their way to box up and cart off the commission’s files. Soon after, he directed Mr. Cuomo’s office to preserve records related to its own involvement with the panel.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="177" data-total-count="38597">Mr. Cuomo later asserted that the Moreland Commission had never, in fact, been independent of him. His involvement, he argued, therefore could not be considered meddling at all.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="38770">“It’s my commission,” the governor told <a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140424/BLOGS04/140429924/cuomo-on-moreland-tampering-its-my-commission">Crain’s New York Business</a> in late April. “I can’t ‘interfere’ with it, because it is mine. It is controlled by me.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="188" data-total-count="38958">But as the federal prosecutor investigates the Moreland panel’s short life and sudden death, questions remain as to why Mr. Cuomo set it up in the first place, and how it fit his agenda.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="263" data-total-count="39221">Meeting with good-government advocates not long after announcing the panel’s shutdown, Mr. Cuomo said that he had never meant to use it merely as leverage. “You can’t set up a government investigations committee to extort the Legislature to act,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="208" data-total-count="39429">On the other hand, he acknowledged that he had made clear to lawmakers in 2013 that if they did not give him the ethics reforms he wanted, he would set up such a commission until they caved in to his demands.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="285" data-total-count="39714">“They thought it was really abusive, and this was just a lever of using subpoenas and embarrassment to extort them to do something that they didn’t want to do,” he said, according to a participant in the meeting. “So they gave us everything that we couldn’t get last year.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="362" data-total-count="40076">And yet when it came to explaining why he had held back from pressing legislators for publicly financed campaigns, which the people he was addressing saw as the ultimate way to purge the power of money in Albany, Mr. Cuomo took the high road. He said that to have used the Moreland Commission as a threat to bring lawmakers to heel would have been out of bounds.</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble-large" data-skip-to-para-id="">
</button>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="151" data-total-count="40227">“I couldn’t say to them, ‘You have to give me a public finance system, or Moreland is going to continue to investigate,’ ” the governor said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="80" data-total-count="40307">“That would have been unethical, by the way — could have even been worse.”</p><footer class="story-footer story-content">
