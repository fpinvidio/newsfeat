Robert E. Lee. A memorial to Confederate soldiers in Durham, N.C., was pulled down by protesters on Monday. Four Confederate monuments were taken down by the city of Baltimore on Wednesday; New Orleans did the same earlier this year.\nBut stiff opposition remains. Debates are raging over whether the statues should fall because they commemorate those who fought to uphold slavery, or stand because they remind us of a history that cannot be erased.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/world/controversial-statues-monuments-destroyed.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
