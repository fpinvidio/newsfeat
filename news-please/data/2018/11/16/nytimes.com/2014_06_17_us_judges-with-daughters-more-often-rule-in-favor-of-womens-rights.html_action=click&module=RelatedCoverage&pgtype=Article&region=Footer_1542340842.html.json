But the effect of having a daughter is even larger when you limit the comparison to judges with only one child.\n“Having one daughter as opposed to one son,” the study found, “is linked to an even higher 16 percent increase in the proportion of gender-related cases decided in a feminist direction.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/us/judges-with-daughters-more-often-rule-in-favor-of-womens-rights.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
