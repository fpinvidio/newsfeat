They organize more of the talks or sanctions that have failed to alter North Korea’s strategic calculus. And they issue threats that, if carried out, would either change little or risk an all-out war.\nBut the best that Washington can hope for, analysts and former officials increasingly say, may be to freeze the program in place. Even this would most likely come at a steep cost, a grim recognition both that the threat is severe and that American leverage is limited.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/world/asia/north-korea-weapons.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
