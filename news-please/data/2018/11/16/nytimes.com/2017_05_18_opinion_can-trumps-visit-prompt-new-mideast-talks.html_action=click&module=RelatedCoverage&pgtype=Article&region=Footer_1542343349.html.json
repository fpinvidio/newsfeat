General McMaster’s phrase, “dignity and self-determination for the Palestinians,” was borrowed from Mr. Abbas. At the Aipac conference, Mr. Pence added that the administration was “also invested in finding an equitable and just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” On “Meet the Press,” Secretary Tillerson denied that an embassy move could be separate from an overall peace initiative.\nAs for Mr. Mattis, his views have hardly been hidden. “I paid a military security price every day as the commander of Centcom because the Americans were seen as biased in support of Israel,” he said in 2013, adding that “moderate Arabs who want to be with us” could not “come out publicly in support of people who don’t show respect for the Arab Palestinians.” Foreign Policy magazine reported, meanwhile, that the State Department is discreetly proposing a 5 percent raise in aid to the Palestinian Authority, to $215 million.\nIn advance of his trip, Mr. Trump has seemed uncharacteristically disciplined in the balancing act he’s expected to perform. An agreement, he told reporters in Mr. Abbas’s presence, “cannot be imposed by the United States, or by any other nation.” That reaffirmed a longstanding Netanyahu position and implied that Mr. Abbas should negotiate without preconditions and without an assurance that the United States would pressure Israel. But then Mr. Trump added, “I will do whatever is necessary to facilitate the agreement — to mediate, to arbitrate anything they’d like to do.” The next day, General McMaster appointed to his national security team Air Force Col. Kris Bauman, who had proposed security arrangements for both sides in 2013.\nMr. Abbas must find President Trump’s inconsistency and reversion to mogul banalities a relief. His people reportedly proposed to Mr. Trump’s people, businesslike, that new talks with Israel could start where Mr. Abbas and Mr. Netanyahu’s predecessor, Ehud Olmert, broke off in 2008, having covered most major issues — security, borders, Jerusalem and refugees — and leaving potentially bridgeable gaps. Nor did Mr. Abbas miss the chance for some tactical flattery, telling Mr. Trump that with his “great negotiating ability,” peace was possible.\nMr. Netanyahu cannot feel equally sanguine. Many have questioned whether Mr. Abbas can survive a new round of peacemaking. Mr. Netanyahu may be wondering whether the administration is inadvertently threatening his fragile coalition. And Mr. Abbas made clear to Mr. Olmert that any Palestinian conception of two states entailed a capital in East Jerusalem and international arrangements for the Holy Basin.\nThe Wall Street Journal has reported that the Saudis and the Emiratis have been discussing an interim plan “aimed in part at aligning them with Mr. Trump” that would establish direct telecommunications links with Israel, allow overflight rights to Israeli aircraft and lift restrictions on some trade — but only if Israel froze settlements outside the large blocks along the Green Line and eased Gaza’s commercial quarantine. Any of these concessions would cause hard-line ministers on the Israeli right to bolt, though they are acceptable to Netanyahu’s rivals in the opposition.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/opinion/can-trumps-visit-prompt-new-mideast-talks.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
