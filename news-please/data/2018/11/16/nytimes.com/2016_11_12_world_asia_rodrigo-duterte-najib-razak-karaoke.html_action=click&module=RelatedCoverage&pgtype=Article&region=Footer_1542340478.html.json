A passion for public singing has led to competitive television shows, a multimillion-dollar business of migrant worker entertainers and several murders.\nMr. Duterte has signaled a shift in his foreign policy from alignment with the United States to increased engagement with regional powers, including China.\nLast month, Mr. Duterte threatened to kick out the American military from bases in the Philippines. In September, President Obama canceled a meeting with Mr. Duterte after the leader offended him. The two men later met briefly on the sidelines of a summit meeting in Laos.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-najib-razak-karaoke.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
