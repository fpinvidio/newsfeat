The retrial was held this week in Shandong, and a local judge announced the verdict on Friday morning, lawyers said. Mr. Chen was again found guilty and given the same sentence, of four years and three months.\nThe retrial has been marred by apparent official efforts at intimidation. Mr. Chen’s wife was kept under close police supervision during the trial.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/01/world/asia/01lawyer.html"}
