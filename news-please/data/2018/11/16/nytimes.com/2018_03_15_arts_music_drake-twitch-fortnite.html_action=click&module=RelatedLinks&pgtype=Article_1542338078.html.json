Signing on as TheBoyDuddus, Drake formed a team with the professional gamer Tyler Blevins, who goes by Ninja and has the largest audience on Twitch, with 3.4 million followers.\nThe stream was soon trending on Twitter, and it hit around 630,000 concurrent views, blowing away the previous record on a single-player stream of 388,000. The pair were also joined by the rapper Travis Scott and the Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster as players in the game, where teams battle to be the last one standing in an apocalyptic landscape.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/arts/music/drake-twitch-fortnite.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article"}
