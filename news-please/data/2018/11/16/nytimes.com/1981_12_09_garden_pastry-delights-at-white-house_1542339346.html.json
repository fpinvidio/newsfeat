''I taste everything, but I do like the wine people do,'' he said. ''I spit it out.''\nMrs. Reagan insists on sampling everything that will be served at official dinners. The executive chef, Henry Haller, presents the dinner at a tasting lunch; the pastry chef, the dessert. The First Lady had Mr. Mesnier make one dessert five times. It was for the dinner in honor of Prince Charles. The chef had fashioned a crown of red, white and blue ice cream. In the center he had placed three feathers - part of the Prince's coat of arms - made of blown sugar.\n''Mrs. Reagan wanted the head of the feathers to be as fine as real feathers,'' the chef recounted as he pulled the spun-sugar clouds for an angel to stand on. ''It's the kind of challenge the 37-year-old pastry chef loves. ''That's the most exciting part -where people know what they want,'' he said.\nWhat Mrs. Reagan wants is lightness. ''Even if I make a tart,'' Mr. Mesnier said, ''I make it thinner, just a coating of fruit, no apricot glaze.''\nWhile the Reagans' Christmas dinner in the White House will have the old-fashioned turkey, giblet gravy, chestnut stuffing and candied sweet potatoes with marshmallows, the dessert will be a decidedly untraditional version of a Yule log, usually made with a genoise that is rolled, filled and frosted with butter cream. This Yule log will be made with graduated layers of meringue and kirsch-flavored pistachio ice cream, covered with chocolate ganache, semisweet chocolate melted and mixed with heavy cream, The decorations, always edible - Mr. Mesnier makes no other kind - will be marzipan angels, leaves, snowmen, stars, candles, Santas and mushrooms.\nThe chef's version of Croquembouche de Noel resembles in shape only the traditional conical layers of pastry-cream-filled pate a choux. It is made of three graduated layers of genoise, each molded in an orange Bavarian cream. After the tiers are assembled, they are decorated with sugar-glazed orange segments and glazed orange peel, cut angel-hair thin. ''My desserts never look the same twice,'' the chef said proudly. ''If I do the same thing, I vary the presentation.''\nFruits are used in many desserts. The Christmas angel is a mold of coconut ice cream filled with raspberry sherbet. It's this same coconut ice cream recipe that the President asked for several times while he was recuperating in the hospital from his wound.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nMr. Mesnier learned his trade in France and Germany, at the Savoy Hotel in London, as the head pastry chef at the Hotel George V and as the corporate pastry chef for the Princess Hotels in Bermuda where he met both his wife, Martha, and Chef Haller. His only other job in the United States was at The Homestead in Hot Springs, Va.\nDetail is one of the reasons Mr. Mesnier likes working at the White House. ''Here on a slow day or for a small party you can go down to the finest detail,'' he said. ''You would never do that at a hotel or in your own shop. Presentation is as important as flavor.'' In his classes at L'Academie de Cuisine in suburban Bethesda, Md., he devotes much of his teaching to detail work.\nMr. Mesnier has always emphasized a preference for working alone. ''At a hotel the food doesn't come out just the way I want because other people do it, but at the White House it does, because I do it myself,'' he said. ''I am a very difficult man when it comes to food.''\nMr. Mesnier's dream is to open ''a small, exclusive shop.'' ''My place would not be a cheap place,'' he said. ''It would have very, very little staff, because if I have something made by someone else, it will not be the same.\n''Even a good cookie is a challenge,'' the pastry chef said. ''With three people here we all bake the cookie, and it will come out different. Someone will understand the ingredients better and therefore will produce something better.''\nMr. Mesnier left no doubt whose cookies would be the best.\nThese recipes were adapted with the help of Rose Levy Beranbaum of the Cordon Rose Cooking School in Manhattan.
