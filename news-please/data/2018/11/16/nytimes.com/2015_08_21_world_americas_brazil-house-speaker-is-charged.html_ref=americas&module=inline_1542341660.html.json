Investigators said that Mr. Cunha, 56, a conservative evangelical Christian radio commentator who broke from President Dilma Rousseff’s governing coalition, was involved in a money-laundering operation that was part of a graft scheme at Petrobras, the national oil company. His problems intensified in July when a consultant for a Petrobras contractor testified that Mr. Cunha had solicited and accepted a $5 million bribe. Mr. Cunha says that he is innocent and that he will remain in his post. The Supreme Court will decide whether he will stand trial.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/21/world/americas/brazil-house-speaker-is-charged.html?ref=americas&module=inline"}
