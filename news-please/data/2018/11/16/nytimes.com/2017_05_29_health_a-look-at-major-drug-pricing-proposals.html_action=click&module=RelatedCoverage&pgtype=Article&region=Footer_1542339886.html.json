It would also give those manufacturers a six-month window during which no other generic drugmaker could compete. This month, , the health subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted to include that measure in its version of the user-fee bill.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/health/a-look-at-major-drug-pricing-proposals.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
