But many companies now find themselves struggling to hire enough workers. And for the scarce workers they do find, pay has more than quintupled in the last decade, to more than $500 a month in coastal provinces.\nChinese businesses and the government are responding by designing and starting to install large numbers of robots, with the goal of keeping factories running and expanding without necessarily causing a drop in overall employment.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/25/technology/robotica-cheaper-robots-fewer-workers.html"}
