Iran would ship some nuclear equipment to Russia. After the deal ends, Iran would still be subject to inspections and unable to produce bomb-grade fuel. It remains unclear whether Iran would have to answer all questions from inspectors about its suspected work on bomb designs.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/02/world/middleeast/2015-03-02-iran.html"}
