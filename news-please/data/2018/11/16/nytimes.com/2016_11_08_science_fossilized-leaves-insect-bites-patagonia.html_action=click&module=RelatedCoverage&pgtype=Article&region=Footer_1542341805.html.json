The findings suggest that ecosystems in different parts of the world repaired themselves at different rates following the asteroid impact.\nLike their modern-day counterparts, ancient beetles, moths, flies, wasps, grasshoppers and other insects all feasted upon plants in unique ways, leaving behind distinct patterns of damage. Some bit holes through leaves while others only munched on the top or bottom layers. Some chewed along the veins of the leaf while others chomped through it. Others used their strawlike mouthparts to pierce the leaves and suck up juices. Larvae burrowed through the leaves and created tunnel marks while eggs leave lumps in the leaves.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/science/fossilized-leaves-insect-bites-patagonia.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
