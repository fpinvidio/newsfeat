Hotels from Italy to Argentina to Iceland are offering savings over the long Thanksgiving weekend. Some packages even include a traditional Thanksgiving dinner with all the trimmings. Here are a few options.\nAt Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco Resort and Spa, in the peaceful Serchio Valley of Italy’s Tuscany region, a Thanksgiving package includes a room with a view, daily breakfast and dinner for two for €210 per night (about $250; compared to €230 per night, without meals). A three-course Thanksgiving feast is included, with a menu of roasted turkey, cranberry sauce and mashed sweet potatoes.\nGrace Cafayate, a hotel and estancia in Argentina’s Calchaquí Valley, is offering a local twist on a typical Thanksgiving celebration. A traditional Argentine asado has been reimagined as a Thanksgiving barbecue under the stars, with clay-oven baked turkey, vegetables off the parrilla, mashed potatoes and classic apple pie, all paired with local wine. The barbecue can be served on the patio of guests’ private villa or in an outdoor dining area overlooking the hotel’s vineyards. This villa package includes buffet breakfast, Thanksgiving dinner for two, and access to the hotel spa for $330, with additional nights available from $210 per night (compared to $245 per night without meals).\nAt Canopy by Hilton Reykjavik City Center, in Iceland, a Northern Lights package includes a 20 percent discount coupon to a Northern Lights Tour, complimentary admission to Aurora Reykjavik Northern Lights Center and scenic rooftop tastings with alcoholic drinks and light bites. Over the Thanksgiving weekend, king premium rooms are available for $479 per night.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/travel/thanksgiving-hotels-deals.html?module=inline"}
