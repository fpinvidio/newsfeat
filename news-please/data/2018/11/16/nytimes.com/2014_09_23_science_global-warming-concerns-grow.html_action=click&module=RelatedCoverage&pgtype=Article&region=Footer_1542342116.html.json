And more than half say global warming is caused by human behavior, the highest level ever recorded by the national poll.\nEconomic issues continue to top the list of most important problems, and only 1 percent of those surveyed last week offered the environment as a top concern for the country. Other concerns, ahead of the environment, were foreign policy, poverty, education, immigration and politics.\nStill, nearly half of the public said global warming was having an impact now. One-quarter said they doubted it would have a serious impact at all, and about three in 10 expected its consequences to show up in the future.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/science/global-warming-concerns-grow.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
