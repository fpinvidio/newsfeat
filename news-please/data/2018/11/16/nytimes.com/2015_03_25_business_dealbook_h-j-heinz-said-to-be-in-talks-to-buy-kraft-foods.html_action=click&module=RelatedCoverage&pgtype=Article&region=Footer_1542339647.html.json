J. Heinz, which it owns with the billionaire Warren E. Buffett — is in talks to buy Kraft Foods, a person briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.\nAs of Tuesday’s market close, Kraft had a market value of about $36.5 billion, meaning that a final price could exceed $40 billion.\nFrom its base in Brazil, 3G has become a powerhouse in the world of food brands. The firm, which counts the billionaire financier Jorge Paulo Lemann among its owners, has made daring moves for companies like Burger King, which it bought in 2010.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/business/dealbook/h-j-heinz-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-kraft-foods.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
