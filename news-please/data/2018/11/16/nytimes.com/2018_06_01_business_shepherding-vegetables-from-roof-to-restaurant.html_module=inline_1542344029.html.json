With shallower soil, it also means we need to use different tools and get more creative with things like trellising tomatoes.\nHow did you learn this farming technique?\nI kept a strawberry patch with my mom as a kid at home in rural Essex, Vermont. I moved to New York City in 2003 to study photography but then became homesick for dirt.\nLiving in Brooklyn, I turned a large backyard into a garden. Then I took intensive classes for seven months in urban farming at the Youth Farm in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and eventually became a manager there. In 2016 I saw an opening at Brooklyn Grange and jumped at the chance.\nHow many types of vegetables and fruits do you grow?\nOn a total of 2.5 acres between our two farms, we have about 50 different crops â€” tomatoes, peppers, arugula, mustards, green beans, eggplant, cucumber, strawberry, plus several kinds of herbs. We grow about 50,000 pounds of organically cultivated produce each year.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/business/shepherding-vegetables-from-roof-to-restaurant.html?module=inline"}
