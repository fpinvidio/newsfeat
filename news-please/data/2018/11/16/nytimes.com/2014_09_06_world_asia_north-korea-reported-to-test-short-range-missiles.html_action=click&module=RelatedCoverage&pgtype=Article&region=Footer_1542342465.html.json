North Korea was also believed to have fired the new missile in a launching last month and another test on Monday.\nAfter firing five missiles in the test last month, North Korea said it successfully tested a newly developed tactical missile.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/world/asia/north-korea-reported-to-test-short-range-missiles.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
