Seelye has covered national news and politics for The New York Times since 1994. She has served since 2012 as the paper’s New England bureau chief, based in Boston.\r\nWhile she grew up outside of Philadelphia, she loves living in New England — her mother’s family is from Belfast, Me. She has covered some of the region’s defining events, including the opioid epidemic, the Whitey Bulger trial, the Boston Marathon bombing and its aftermath and, of course, the record snowfall in the winter of 2015, when she managed to quote James Joyce. She hopes that on her watch, the mystery of the 1990 heist of valuable art works from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum — the world’s biggest art theft — will be solved.\r\nBefore moving to Boston, Ms. Seelye worked in the Washington bureau for 12 years and covered multiple beats, from Congress to the White House, and she slogged along “on the bus” on six presidential campaigns. She pioneered The Times’s online coverage of politics, and in 2007 became the paper’s first online political writer.", "filename": "by_katharine-q-seelye_1542343510.html", "image_url": "https://static.nytimes.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "language": "en", "localpath": "/Users/federicoperezinvidio/Projects/illinois/newsfeat/news-please//data/2018/11/16/nytimes.com/by_katharine-q-seelye_1542343510.html", "title": "Katharine Q.
