Brace for Possible Release of Secret Memo - The New York Times", "title_rss": "NULL", "source_domain": "nytimes.com", "text": "Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein went to the White House on Monday in the hopes of getting West Wing aides to in turn persuade Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, to delay the vote that night, according to a current administration official and a former one who were familiar with the events. Mr. Wray and Mr. Rosenstein spoke with John F. Kelly, the presidentâ€™s chief of staff, but were unsuccessful.\nEven without having seen it, Mr. Trump, whose preferred cable channel, Fox News, has focused on the memo extensively, has told people close to him that he feels strongly that the memo makes the case that F.B.I. and Justice Department officials acted inappropriately when they sought the highly classified warrant in October 2016 on the campaign adviser, Carter Page.\nThe memo, drafted by Republicans on the Intelligence Committee staff, is said to contend that officials from the two agencies were not forthcoming to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge in seeking the warrant. Republicans accuse the agencies of failing to properly disclose that Democrats financed research used in the application for the warrant, people familiar with the memo said. The research was assembled by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, who produced a dossier of unsubstantiated allegations about Mr. Trump.\nThe memo is also said to highlight the role of Mr. Rosenstein, who authorized the renewal of the surveillance of Mr. Page in the spring of 2017. People who have read the memo say it mentions Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy director of the F.B.I., who has been a target of the president and Republicans in Congress. Mr. McCabe stepped down on Monday, telling people close to him that he felt pressured to because of a separate Justice Department inspector general investigation.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/us/politics/memo-release-fbi-justice-white-house.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
