Unanswered emails. Co-workers hauling luggage to meetings so they can head straight to Grandma’s. And for some of us, the unglamorous response to the question, “Where are you going for the holidays?”\nNowhere.\nAt first, we feel a pang — the kind that sets in as we hug loved ones goodbye at airport security or watch their taxi pull away, only to remember we’re going home alone.\nBut then we become the lucky ones.\nWe get to watch the city boil down to its barest form. And, like a candle burning brighter as it melts away the wax, this empty New York becomes more radiant than ever.\nThe small pleasures of life here — the delicate details often swallowed by the city’s fast and unforgiving pace — find their way back into focus.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/nyregion/new-york-today-alone-in-nyc-holidays.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Falexandra-s.-levine&module=inline"}
