Do not use emotionally charged words such as ‘slump,’ ‘spike’ or ‘collapse.’ ”\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nOther newspapers and websites in China reported on the market turmoil, though often presenting China as an unlikely bystander in a wider global downturn.\nSome parts of the Chinese news media that are less firmly yoked to echoing the party leadership’s positions voiced rival views of what the government should do about the stock market slump. Some said the government should do more. Others said it was time to quit intervening.\nSecurities Daily, a leading financial newspaper, seized the opportunity to urge the government to do more to prop up stock prices. “The slump in the stock markets is destroying what remains of investor confidence, and this problem is profoundly serious,” the paper said in a front-page commentary. It called for stronger government measures to shore up stock prices.\nChina’s economic fundamentals remain sound, it said, but “the stock markets’ reactions to these fundamentals have become extremely chilly, and pessimistic sentiment has continued to spread.” The commentary called for continued government intervention in the markets to counter what it called “irrational” and “malicious” sell-offs.\nBut The Economic Information Daily, a newspaper issued by the Xinhua news agency, argued that the Chinese government should retreat from trying to shore up the stock markets. Instead, the paper said, policy makers must focus on improving economic conditions, such as making it easier for businesses to attract loans and investment.\n“The turbulence in global stock markets has largely arisen from volatile sentiment, and not because major problems have hit the economy,” it said in a front-page commentary.\n“The domestic policy focus should be on steadily retreating from stock market bailout policies,” it said. “Government bailouts are meant to avert financial risks, not to prop up stock prices. Although A-shares have suffered another substantial fall, we still need to stick to steadily phasing out bailout measures.”\nEven as frazzled Chinese investors endured another day of market tumult on Tuesday, there was some light relief. Chinese news websites featured images of a massive sculpture in the coastal city of Xiamen that depicted a bull astride a bear.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe sculpture was intended to symbolize bullish, upbeat market forces subduing bearish pessimism, according to the news reports. On the Internet, however, some Chinese commenters said the sculpture appeared to show something more intimate going on between the two beasts.\nCai Mingchao, the businessman and art collector who commissioned the sculpture, said he hoped it would ease some of the stresses of weary investors.\n“Actually, this is for stock investors to let off steam,” Mr. Cai said, according to Xiamen Daily. “If everyone is more upbeat, then maybe the stock market will be too.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/world/asia/chinese-news-media-largely-silent-amid-stock-market-turmoil.html?module=inline"}
