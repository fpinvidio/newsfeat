The university will also provide additional support to students, faculty and staff members who experience discrimination; create a task force to create plans for improving diversity and inclusion; and require diversity and inclusion training for all faculty, staff members and incoming students.\nJosh Earnest, the White House press secretary, praised the protests as showing “that a few people speaking up and speaking out can have a profound impact.”\nOfficials said Mr. Loftin would remain at the university in a research role.\nOpposition to the administration reached a peak in the last week. A graduate student, Jonathan Butler, who was a veteran of the Ferguson protests, held a highly publicized hunger strike, saying he would not eat again until Mr. Wolfe was gone. Protesters formed an encampment on campus. A coalition of Jewish groups told Mr. Loftin that they were “dismayed” by his lack of action after a swastika was drawn on a dormitory wall. Deans of nine of its schools called for Mr. Loftin’s removal.\nOn Monday morning, the student government demanded Mr. Wolfe’s ouster, and much of the faculty sent word to students that classes were canceled for two days, in favor of a teach-in focused on race relations.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/us/university-of-missouri-system-president-resigns.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
