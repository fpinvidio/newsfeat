Despite the government intervention, Chinese stocks have been in a deep slump, off about 40 percent in the last 12 months.\n“International institutional investors clearly indicated that they would like to see further improvements in the accessibility of the China A shares market before its inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index,” Remy Briand, the global head of research at MSCI, said in a statement on Tuesday.\nMSCI said it would reconsider A shares for inclusion in 2017.\nThe index provider’s decision to delay for another year highlights persistent concerns among global investors about government meddling in local markets as well as the quality of regulation and company accounts.\n“Accounting in China is a state secret,” said Hugh Young, who oversees investments in Asia for Aberdeen, one of the world’s largest emerging markets investors. “Our money goes into companies, and we have had trouble finding the right ones to invest in.”\nMost large investors get their China equity exposure by investing in large companies listed in Hong Kong or other overseas markets — like the internet giants Tencent and Alibaba — where companies must adhere to globally accepted financial rules and regulations. MSCI’s weighing toward China was already 25 percent, the largest of all the countries it tracks; analysts were guessing that China’s inclusion would add another 1 percent of Chinese exposure.\nMSCI said investors were also bothered by the stiff limits imposed on foreign investors withdrawing their funds from China.\nThe verdict will do little to lift the mood in China’s once bustling brokerage halls.\nOn a recent afternoon inside a poorly lit trading hall near People’s Park in Shanghai, a dozen or so elderly investors were chatting among themselves as the final minutes of another trading day ticked away.\nAs the stock prices flashing on a bank of 21 LCD screens attested, the main Shanghai share index had staged a modest rally to recover from its earlier losses. But once again, the index had slumped back down into negative turf by the 3 p.m. close.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n“It’s not about waiting it out, because if you try you will probably get wiped out,” said Mr. Ye, a 62-year-old retiree who declined to give his full name when speaking critically about the government’s stock market rescue efforts.\n“It is really painful,” he added, estimating that most of the investors at the Shanghai trading hall had lost money over the past year. “This market isn’t really regulated.”\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They had more than doubled over the previous 12 months.\nAt the time, the company said it was concerned about a number of restrictions in China. Certain rules made it challenging for global investors to move money in and out of the country, or even to prove with certainty their ownership of shares.\nGlobal investors also fretted about the curious ability of Chinese companies to stop trading in their stock whenever it seemed to suit their own needs. The practice stopped shares under pressure from falling further, but it did so by preventing investors from cashing out.\nWith an eye on making the cut at MSCI, China sought to address these concerns in recent months.\nLast month, China’s stock exchanges published new rules that discouraged companies from halting trading in their own shares. China also took steps to give foreign investors greater access to its markets by increasing investment quotas.\nLast week, China said it would grant an initial renminbi-denominated investment quota to the United States, allowing American funds to purchase stocks worth as much as 250 billion renminbi, or $38 billion. American investors could previously buy into Chinese stocks through other methods, but the new quota provided significant direct access and ranked as the second-biggest of its kind under the renminbi program, after Hong Kong’s.\nThis follows previous moves to open up mainland markets through a newer link between the Hong Kong and Shanghai markets, although it is also subject to investment caps and quotas. Chinese officials have said they plan to make stocks listed in Shenzhen eligible for the same scheme, connecting them to the Hong Kong market later this year.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nStill, efforts to improve market regulations may be cold comfort for ordinary Chinese investors who are still nursing losses from last year’s stock market fallout.\nMr. Tao, a 63-year-old retiree at the Shanghai brokerage who declined to give his first name because he spoke critically of the government’s actions, said he used a bit of his monthly pension of 1,600 renminbi, or $243, to dabble in the stock market.\nTaking a break outside the brokerage to chat over a red Double Happiness cigarette, Mr. Tao said he was sitting on tidy profits until the market turned downward last June.\nSince then, his investments have given back more than 70 percent of those gains.\n“In investing, one misstep and you’re nabbed,” Mr. Tao said.\nHe added that it could take years to recover his lost profits. “Now I just want to wait it out,” he said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/business/dealbook/msci-delays-adding-china-stock-to-emerging-markets-benchmark.html"}
