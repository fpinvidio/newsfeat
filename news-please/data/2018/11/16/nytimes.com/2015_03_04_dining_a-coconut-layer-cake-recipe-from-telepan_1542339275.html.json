It’s even more surprising when it’s a fluffy coconut number, as shaggy and proud as anything you’d see on a diner counter under a cake dome — but about a thousand times more delicious.\nI had such a cake at Telepan Local, the chef Bill Telepan’s short-lived TriBeCa restaurant. I was expecting something deconstructed and elaborate, along the lines of the elegant quince granita parfaits and Concord grape gelées they offer at the original Telepan, on the Upper West Side.\nTo my delight, the pastry chef Larissa Raphael’s coconut layer cake was as classic as they come, just better than most.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/dining/a-coconut-layer-cake-recipe-from-telepan.html"}
