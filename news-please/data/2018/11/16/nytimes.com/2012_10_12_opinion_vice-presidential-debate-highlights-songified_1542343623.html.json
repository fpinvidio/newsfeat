More like DemoCRAZY!!! Electoral College? More like Electoral PRESCHOOL!!! Vice President? More like Vice GET ME OUTTA HEEEEEERE!!!”\nIt’s at times like these that we just wish politicians would finally learn a lesson from Mozart, Cole Porter and Rihanna . All that angst, anger and conflict might sound terrible as a spoken sentence, but when transformed into soaring melodies, human troubles can change into timeless art.\nWith that in mind, we present you the vice-presidential debate as it should be: Songified. It is our hope that someday, the vice-presidential candidates of the future will learn a lesson and just sing the whole thing to begin with.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/opinion/vice-presidential-debate-highlights-songified.html"}
