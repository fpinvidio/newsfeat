But obviously, what happens, the thing that is different, if I’m running in a Republican primary, you know obviously you end up being constrained. But, I just, if you could, I’m not asking any different than I have the entire 10 years and eight months that I have been in office. You know, and one of the reasons, the main reason was the statement that I made. You know, I told people, I didn’t intend to serve more than two terms, that’s been a really big drag on me.\nBut in addition to that, the other part of our statement was true that the next 15 months we believe to be the most important time of our service and to be constrained by looking over your shoulder with some winger running against you, you know, let’s face it that impedes your ability to serve. So I just — again, I haven’t like changed course I just don’t have the worry.\nI actually can continue over the next 15 months being the same senator that I’ve been. So, sure, I mean the president concerns me. I mean there’s no question. And, I like him. O.K., I enjoyed playing golf with him, you know, he’s a very courteous kind person. It’s not that I dislike him.\nMARTIN: Right.\nCORKER: I know for a fact that every single day at the White House it’s a situation of trying to contain him.\nMARTIN: Yeah.\nCORKER: Look, you know that. It’s not like —\nMARTIN: Yes, you’re right.\nCORKER: I mean, you’ve talked to enough people to know that that’s just a fact. So, thankfully we’ve got some very good people there. At least today, we’ve got some very good people there and they have been able to push back against his worst instincts.\nMARTIN: Yeah.\nCORKER: But yes, I mean, you know, yes. He concerns me. I mean he would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation. But a lot people that — Let me put it this way, I think that — So I’ll just stop there. Sure, I mean, do I want him to be successful? Absolutely.\nMARTIN: Let me just —\nCORKER: Have we worked with him. Are you still here?\nMARTIN: Yes, sir. I’m here, I’m here. Yes, sir. I’m here, I can hear you.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/us/politics/bob-corker-trump-interview-transcript.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
