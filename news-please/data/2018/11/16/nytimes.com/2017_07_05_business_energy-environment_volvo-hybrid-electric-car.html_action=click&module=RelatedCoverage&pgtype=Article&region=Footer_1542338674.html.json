On the contrary, United States automakers have continued to churn out S.U.V.s and pickup trucks, whose sales have surged because of relatively low fuel prices.\nYet Volvo’s move may be the latest sign that the era of the gas guzzler is slowly coming to an end. Tesla, which makes only limited numbers of electric cars, surpassed Ford and General Motors this year in terms of stock market value, despite making significantly fewer cars than those automotive giants — a clear indication of where investors think the industry is headed.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/business/energy-environment/volvo-hybrid-electric-car.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
