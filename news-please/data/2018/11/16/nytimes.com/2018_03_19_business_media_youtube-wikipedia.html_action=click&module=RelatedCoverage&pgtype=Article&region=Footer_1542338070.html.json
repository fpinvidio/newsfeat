Whatever benefit Google hopes to get from using the online encyclopedia to fact-check YouTube videos is likely to pale in comparison with the value it receives from including Wikipedia entries in its search results.\nGoogle’s “Knowledge Graph,” which displays certain answers to search queries in separate, authoritative-looking boxes on the right side of a computer screen, draws heavily from Wikipedia. Furthermore, virtually every voice assistant, including Amazon’s Echo and Apple’s Siri, uses the site to give customers a wide range of answers to their questions.\nWikipedia has also proved invaluable to tech companies as they develop artificial intelligence and translation services — as a multilanguage corpus for researchers, it is unparalleled (and, of course, free).\n“The degree to which the Wikipedia data has informed computer science is pretty astonishing,” said Brent Hecht, an assistant professor at Northwestern University who has studied Wikipedia’s relationships with tech companies and online communities. “Wikipedia definitely creates massively more value for these companies than they put in.”\nWith the YouTube announcement, Wikipedia finds itself in a predicament similar to that of a small town after it has been chosen as the site of a new Walmart: Some municipalities have said that the retail giant creates undue stress on local police forces, straining them to the breaking point with endless calls to deal with petty crimes at the super stores.\nWikipedia’s lopsided relationships can also amplify pre-existing internal problems. Its contributors skew white and male, for example, leading to predictable outcomes — just 17 percent of the subjects of biographies on the site are women. Wikipedia is taking steps to address the issue, but the next generation of consumer tech is being built on top of it — and its gaps and biases — in the meantime.\nHaving come of age in the era of desktop and laptop computers, Wikipedia is also struggling to bring itself into the smartphone era (not to mention whatever comes next).", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/media/youtube-wikipedia.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer"}
