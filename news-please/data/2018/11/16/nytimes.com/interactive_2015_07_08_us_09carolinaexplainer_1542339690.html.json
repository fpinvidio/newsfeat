It sits on a high gunmetal black pole, but there is no winch or rope at ground-level that would make it easy for a person to lower it without special equipment.\nAt around 10 a.m. Thursday, two capitol building workmen were consulting with a man, apparently on the mechanics of bringing it down â€“ there was talk of whether a box truck, like the kind used by electrical repairmen, would be needed. Neither provided an answer on the plan for removal.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/08/us/09carolinaexplainer.html"}
