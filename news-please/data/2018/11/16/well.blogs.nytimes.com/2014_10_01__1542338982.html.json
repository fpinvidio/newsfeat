I usually use yogurt or buttermilk in my smoothies, but this week I wanted to make some drinks using almond milk and coconut milk. I looked around for some brands that tasted good to me (and I did need to look around), and found some great almond milk made with just about only almonds and water (it has less than 2 percent added ingredients but no sweeteners). For the others, I wanted to use coconut milk, not coconut water, which I think tastes pretty bad no matter how good for you it’s supposed to be. I used light coconut milk in conjunction with almond milk in a few of this week’s smoothies.\nThough I recently devoted a week of Recipes for Health to green smoothies, these smoothies are pure fruit; they are not low-carb. Most of them make filling breakfasts or snacks and will appeal to you if you are vegan and enjoy fruit. I have bulked them up with soaked nuts, chia seeds and oatmeal and added very little in the way of sweeteners. I liked the green smoothies, but I still prefer to eat my vegetables in solid form.\nYou don’t need a special high-powered blender for this week’s drinks. I’m still using the 5-cup, 2-speed Waring blender my mother gave me years ago and it works just fine.\nBerry Coconut Almond Smoothie : Cinnamon is the secret ingredient in this rich berry smoothie.\nBanana Oatmeal Almond Smoothie : Oatmeal bulks up this smoothie, making it more filling.\nFrozen Strawberry-Coconut Smoothie With Pomegranate Molasses : Fruity pomegranate molasses is the perfect sweetener for this thick strawberry smoothie.\nPeach Almond Smoothie : Peaches and almonds are closely related and make a great match in this not-too-sweet smoothie.\nCantaloupe-Lime Agua Fresca With Chia Seeds : A light, refreshing blender drink that is sweet and a little bit tart.", "url": "https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/smoothies-hold-the-dairy/"}
