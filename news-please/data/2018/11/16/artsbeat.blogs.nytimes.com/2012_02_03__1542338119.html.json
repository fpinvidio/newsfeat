Logan Cunningham, narrator of the popular downloadable game Bastion, served as host of the awards presentation for about 250 fans at the Cantor Film Center at New York University. Daniel Radosh, a writer for “The Daily Show,” presented a comedy segment at the ceremony.\nHarold Goldberg, a magazine writer and the group’s founder, said that 21 New York-area game critics had voted on the awards. In addition to Skyrim, the physics-based puzzle hit Portal 2 won the Herman Melville Award for best writing and the Great White Way Award for best acting. Crysis 2, in which Manhattan has been transformed into a battleground between humans and aliens, took the Manhattan Award for most New York-centric game.\n“We created the Critics Circle not only to talk intelligently about games but to also become a vibrant force in New York City,” Mr. Goldberg said in a telephone interview on Friday. “We want to spread the word that the best games can be as artful and soulful as movies and books, so its proper that we have an organization like this here. Having these awards is a part of that process.”\nA full list of winners and additional information about the group can be found here. (I had dinner once, in 2011, with Mr. Goldberg and two other Critics Circle members as an invited guest. But I did not vote on the awards.)", "url": "https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/skyrim-wins-video-game-critics-award/"}
