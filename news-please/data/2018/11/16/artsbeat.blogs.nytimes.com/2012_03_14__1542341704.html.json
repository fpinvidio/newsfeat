He added that an attending veterinarian administered “immediate aid to the injured horse and determined that humane euthanasia was appropriate.”\nThe American Humane Association, which monitors the use of animals in “Luck” and other television and film productions, said in a statement reported by The Associated Press that it is demanding “that all production involving horses shut down.” The statement added, “We are also insisting that this stoppage remain in full effect pending a complete, thorough and comprehensive investigation.”\nIn a post on its blog, the advocacy group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said: “We think — and we hope law enforcement agrees — that the way in which the horses were treated by the production company, the trainer and the veterinarian warrants a swift and thorough investigation before yet another horse dies. Human affection for horses unfortunately makes them popular subjects for the film industry. Horses may grab our attention, but these animals are not willing participants in the entertainment industry.”\nHBO said in a statement that the network and “everyone involved with the production are deeply saddened,” and that it was “working in full cooperation” with the American Humane Association and the California Horse Racing Board on an inquiry.", "url": "https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/questions-raised-after-third-horse-dies-on-hbos-luck/"}
