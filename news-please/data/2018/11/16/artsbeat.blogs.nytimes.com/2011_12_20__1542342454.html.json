Parris III is on tour with members of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, documenting, through a series of drawings and paintings, their two-year legacy tour. After 58 years the company is scheduled to disband on New Year’s Day 2012. This is the 23rd in a series of graphite drawings that Mr. Parris plans to create from the road, providing a front-row seat to the final weeks of the company’s journey. This week’s entry is from Paris.\nEmma Desjardins\nMr. Parris wrote: “The Company’s final trip to Paris includes two programs and ten shows in just under two weeks. It’s enough time to settle in and do some cooking for those that like to do so. ‘The Bastille Market is the best,’ said Emma Desjardins. After strolling through rows of booths and filling several bags with all kinds of fresh food, she added, ‘now I have to hurry because I’m going to be late for yoga.’”", "url": "https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/drawing-dance-the-merce-cunningham-dance-company-in-paris/"}
