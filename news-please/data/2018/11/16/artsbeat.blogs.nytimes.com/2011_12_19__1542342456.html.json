But things promise to be even more active than usual next month, when a new event called the Times Square International Theater Festival makes its debut.\nThe event, which will run Jan. 16 to 22, will feature nearly a score of works from three continents at the Times Square Arts Center on West 43rd Street. The festival is being organized by Roy Arias, an actor who has worked in both English and Spanish, and Alfred Preisser, who was the founding director of the Classical Theater of Harlem and is starting a new theater company next year.\nOn opening night, the offerings will range from “Horripilation!,” which draws from ancient Indian theater, to “Breve Temporada de Invierno,” or “Brief Winter Season,” a two-character Cuban comedy performed in Spanish by actors from Argentina and Puerto Rico. Other plays to be featured include “On the Field of Blood,” a religious drama from Ukraine, and “Match,” a German production whose 11-member cast is composed of German, French, Hungarian, Iranian and Kurdish actors.\nTickets for all productions other than staged readings will be $18 in advance and $20 at the door, with age and student discounts available. A festival pass will be available for $99.", "url": "https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/january-a-rich-month-for-international-theater-in-new-york/"}
