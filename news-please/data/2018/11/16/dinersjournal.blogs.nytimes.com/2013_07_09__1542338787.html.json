What wine doesn’t? Savory, pungent sausages seem to bond instantly with countless wines. Simply look for ones that are as elemental, casual and juicy as the sausages themselves. With Italian sausages, you’ll most likely want a red, and for warm-weather grilling it ought to enjoy a light chill. Translation: avoid tannins and oaky flavors. What does that leave? Only much of the low-priced red wine universe. Allow me to make a list, beginning in Italy: barbera, dolcetto, Valpolicella, Chianti, Montepulciano d’Abruzzo, to name a few. If grilling French sausages, you might start with Beaujolais, or an easygoing Chinon or Bourgueil. But no need to get hung up on ethnicities. Look for an American gamay noir, or one of the good reds from the Canary Islands, or a dry rosé. For summer rentals, don’t rely on local selections — B.Y.O.B.\nWhat would you pair with this recipe for grilled sausages and radicchio?
