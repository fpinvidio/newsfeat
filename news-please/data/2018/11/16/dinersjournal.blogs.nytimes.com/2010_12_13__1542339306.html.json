It’s certainly less expensive than his former digs, Aquavit. To start, main courses at dinner will be $14 to $28. Soon, he’ll have a $16 three-course prix-fixe lunch. “Restaurant Week lunches for $24 are not relevant in Harlem,” Mr. Samuelsson said.\nComfort food is on the menu, with some icons like fried chicken. Mr. Samuelsson added some Scandanavian references too, including gravlax and Helga’s meatballs, from his Swedish grandmother’s recipe. The chef is Andrea Bergquist.\nThere’s an interesting selection of beers on the beverage list.\nAbout half the space is taken up with a big, semicircular copper-topped bar. “It’s a reference to the many diners here,” he said. “Some have closed, but diners have defined the restaurant scene in Harlem to a large extent.” Though the restaurant will open only for dinner initially, breakfast and lunches will be served at the bar.\nThe dining room has a big open kitchen, bare tables with bentwood chairs. On the lower level there is a private dining room and also a performance space. Mr. Samuelsson plans to give cooking classes there. “You have to start a conversation with the community so they can participate and understand the whole farm-to-table approach,” he said.\nRed Rooster Harlem, 310 Lenox Avenue (125th Street), Harlem, (212) 792-9001.", "url": "https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/red-rooster-is-ready/"}
