The restaurant menu and the menu available at the lanes are by David Burke.\nEach of the bowling alley areas has a theme, like Chinatown and Times Square, with food, but the food is not particularly New York oriented. Mr. Burke pushes the typical sports bar envelope with Chinese chicken wings, meatloaf with garlic prawns, sausage and shrimp macaroni and cheese, and cured salmon pizza. Many of the Stadium Grill menu items are also available at the various bowling lanes.\nStadium Grill, 222 West 44th Street, (212) 680-0012.", "url": "https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/dining-at-the-new-bowlmor-lanes/"}
