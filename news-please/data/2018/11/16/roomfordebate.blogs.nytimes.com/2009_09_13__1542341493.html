<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mexico last month adopted a law that decriminalizes the possession of small amounts of marijuana and harder drugs, including cocaine and heroin. Other countries in Latin America are considering similar changes in their laws, prompting antidrug groups in the U.S. to say that pressure from south of the border will push the United States toward decriminalization, if not legalization, of drugs.  </p>

<h4>A Modest <em>and</em> Gigantic Shift</h4>
<div class="w50 left"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs/roomfordebate/contributors/tony_payan.50.jpg" alt="Tony Payan" /></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em> <strong><a href="//faculty.utep.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=10618">Tony Payan </a></strong>is an associate professor of political science at the University of Texas at El Paso and is also on the faculty of the Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez.<br />
</em><br />
Mexico decriminalized the possession (but not the production, trade, and distribution) of drugs. So did Argentina and Colombia. The move is, as politicians explain it, designed to curb police corruption &#8212; bribing people when caught with small amounts of drugs. </p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>The new policies in conservative Latin America reflect disillusionment with the United States war on drugs.  </p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If they said any more about it, they would be wrong — and they know it, as they do not make any claims that this measure will result in less drug-related violence. Indeed, if they asked me, will decriminalization of the possession of small amounts of drugs save a single life in Ciudad Juárez, where there have been about 3,200 murders in 21 months, my answer would be a rotund no. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But decriminalizing drug possession is in and of itself a change of, paradoxically, gigantic and modest proportions. Gigantic because it is a solid first step to pave the way for 1) distinguishing between drug use and drug abuse 2) paving the way for fully medicalizing abuse, that is, reinforcing the idea that we should treat drug addicts much as alcoholics and offer them help instead of prison time, and 3) focusing state resources on the production, trafficking and distribution networks. But modest because it still commits governments to continue their war on drugs, just not on the user.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">What is surprising is the fact that this change is coming from Latin America, a Catholic, largely conservative continent. This represents a cultural shift that may mean that Latin America is changing but also that it is increasingly disappointed with the American approach to drugs and the futility of its strategies and tactics. </p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the end the United States may be left alone to fight a 40-year-old failed “war on drugs” or join the rest and craft a more nuanced strategy to consider other possibilities in dealing with psychotropic substances. Perhaps this time change will come from South to North, instead of North to South.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> President Obama has not defined his own strategy, adopting by default the policy in place for almost a century. But before he does, he would do well engaging former and current Latin American presidents and figure out what they perceive that he cannot yet see. </p>

<h4>What Decriminalization?</h4>
<div class="w50 left"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs/roomfordebate/contributors/jorge_castaneda.50.jpg" alt="Jorge Castaneda" /></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><strong>Jorge Castañeda</strong> is the Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York University. He was foreign minister of Mexico from 2000 to 2003. </em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The recently approved new &#8220;drug&#8221; law in Mexico is in fact not a step toward decriminalization, but rather toward mandatory sentencing. Until last month, possession of small (unspecified) amounts of drugs was not a criminal offense in Mexico; only the sale or purchase was. The new law establishes a minuscule limit on legal possession, meaning that today, almost anyone caught carrying any drug is subject to arrest, prosecution and jail. </p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>If anything, the new law  criminalizes drug use much more radically than before.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If anything, the new law  criminalizes drug use much more radically than before, and it is probably for this reason that President Calderón signed it, and that the Obama administration has looked the other way. It will almost certainly not attract US &#8220;drug tourists&#8221; to Mexico, since the risk of being arrested for possession has grown considerably with the new law, whereas before the real risk was just a shakedown by the authorities.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The law actually is part of a campaign to justify President Calderón&#8217;s war of choice on drugs by stating that drug consumption in Mexico has increased over the past 10 years.  In fact, the government&#8217;s own unpublished but leaked National Addiction Survey for 2008 shows that this is not the case. The growth of marijuana, heroin and metaphetamine consumption  is flat in all categories (addiction, occasional use, at-least-once-in-a-lifetime use), and while cocaine addiction, for example, did rise from 300 000 victims in 2002 to 450 000 in 2008 (a 50 percent increase, or roughly 6 percent per year), it did so from a tiny baseline,  for a tiny percentage (0.4 percent) of Mexico&#8217;s population, a much smaller share than  for the U.S., Western Europe and practically every country in Latin America.</p>

<div class="hiddenContent" style="display: none;">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mexico should move toward decriminalization, but it cannot do so if the United States does not. Among the many reasons is the so-called Zurich effect, i.e., what occurred in the Swiss city in the 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s when it was one of only a couple of European towns that had legalized virtually all drug use, and consequently attracted thousands of users from across Europe, eventually forcing the city to shut down its &#8220;needle park&#8221; and abrogate decriminalization.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If the current movement toward legalized medical use of marijuana and/or decriminalization prospers and expands in the U.S., Mexico will be able to move in the same direction, and perhaps reduce the tremendous cost the war on drugs is imposing on Mexican society, without any visible results or hope for success.</p>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mexico’s President Calderon got it wrong on decriminalizing drugs.  I fear for the future of Mexico and the domino effect here at home.</p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>Creating an environment where it is easier to use drugs will enhance the market for traffickers. </p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A better way to distinguish users from dealers is to increase drug courts and treatment facilities and the frequency of referrals of low-level drug offenders into these programs.  Drug courts save lives, holding users accountable while leveraging them into treatment.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Treating users as though they merely were speeding by imposing a minor fine is not in the best interest of Mexico’s citizens.  Ignoring the behavior or fining them eliminates the opportunity for meaningful intervention.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Drug users are not innocent.  They support the vicious drug cartels.  Without their demand for drugs, the supply side has no purpose.  Since terrorists depend on the drug market to fund their activities, users are potentially aiding terrorism.  Because drug traffickers are frequently linked with weapons and human trafficking, users are also supporting these activities. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Drugs put more impaired drivers on the highways, endangering others. They make workers less productive and less safe.  Users utilize more health-care benefits, increasing insurance costs.  In the U.S., about 75 percent of children in foster care are victims of drug-abusing parents and roughly 60 percent of domestic abuse and 80 percent of workplace thefts are drug-related.  Drug use is linked to crime, school dropout, and teenage pregnancy.  All of this will likely increase, further burdening Mexico’s judicial system, which is already hanging by a thin thread.</p>

<h4>A Welcome Shift</h4>
<div class="w50 left"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs/roomfordebate/contributors/peter_reuter.50.jpg" alt="Peter Reuter" /></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><strong><a href="//www.publicpolicy.umd.edu/facstaff/faculty/Reuter.html">Peter Reuter</a></strong> is a professor in the School of Public Policy and the Department of Criminology  at the University of Maryland.<br />
</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mexico is one of several Latin American countries that want to avoid a war on local drug users &#8212; even as it deals with horrific violence arising from the international drug trade. The country has therefore considered decriminalizing the possession of illicit drugs for personal use.</p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>Mexico’s most severe drug-related crime and violence arise almost entirely from U.S. demand for illicit drugs. </p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Evidence from other countries suggests that decriminalization could be modestly helpful in addressing Mexico’s recent difficulties. The most analogous recent experience is that of Portugal, which decriminalized drug possession in 2001.  When these measures were implemented, critics feared that decriminalization would lead to increased drug use, and that drug users across the European Union would congregate there. To all outward appearances, decriminalization produced none of the feared effects.  Given that drug users in Portugal were hardly ever arrested before 2001, the result was not surprising.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mexico has been similarly restrained in enforcing its own drug possession laws. Removing the possible deterrent effect of criminal prosecution is thus unlikely to make much difference to the decision to experiment with drugs in Mexico. Given the corruption that has been revealed in endless scandals at all levels of Mexican drug enforcement, one major attraction of decriminalization is that it reduces the number of ways that local police can extort the populace, including U.S. college students sampling various intoxicants on their spring vacations.</p>
<div class="toggleContent">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="showContent">Read more&#8230;</a></p>
<div class="hiddenContent" style="display: none;">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The prior U.S. drug czar would no doubt have lectured Mexico about spreading poison, as he lectured Canada when it was contemplating decriminalizing marijuana.  The current czar, perhaps observing that our nation is by far this hemisphere’s largest consumer, is showing admirable good sense and restraint in letting other nations experiment with policies that would be politically unacceptable within our own borders.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Unfortunately, decriminalization will not address Mexico’s most severe drug-related crime and violence.  These problems arise almost entirely from U.S. demand for illicit drugs.  Decriminalizing drug possession within Mexico may thus prove entirely sensible. Even so, these policies are likely to leave our southern neighbor with much the same constellation of drug-related violence as it now confronts.</p>

<h4>Fear-Mongering Is Unjustified</h4>

<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><strong>Ethan Nadelmann</strong> is executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance.<br />
</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The recent decriminalization of drug possession in Mexico is good for Mexico, good for the U.S., and consistent with the broader trend in Europe, Latin America and elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote> The Jamaican drug tourism industry has nothing to fear from Mexico’s reform.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The new law eliminates criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of drugs, authorizes treatment instead of incarceration for addicts, refrains from forcing “rehabilitation” on consumers who are not addicted, and legitimizes the ritual and cultural use of drugs like peyote.  This should, in theory, result in fewer people being incarcerated for nothing more than drug use or possession, and allow police to focus on more serious crimes.  Such reforms generally do not result in higher rates of drug use &#8212; at least that’s the evidence from other countries. And it will have no impact on President Calderon’s battle with the major drug trafficking organizations.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> It’s hard to see the law encouraging “drug tourism” from the United States, and certainly nothing to compare with the “tourism” generated by Mexico’s lower drinking age and easy access to lower cost pharmaceutical drugs.  Nothing in the law authorizes the creation of Dutch-like coffee shops selling marijuana openly.  The Jamaican tourism industry has nothing to fear from Mexico’s reform. And Americans generally prefer the higher quality marijuana grown in our own country.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> Why did the Obama administration refrain from criticizing the Mexican reform?  Probably because it understands that it will have no impact on drug use or trafficking in the United States.  But perhaps it also is coming to the conclusion that criminalization of drug possession typically does more harm than good.</p>

			<p>it is time to stop the idiotic &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; in which the victims are the populace who use a relatively innocuous drug, marijuana &#8211; compared to liquor and tobacco- and where the victors are the drug lords who laugh at the stupidity of the hypocritical moralizing of the US government.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to allow medical use of MJ as well as the recreational use of it.  Treat overuse as an addiction, just as we do with alcohol, and should do with tobacco products.</p>
<p>Never in the history of the world have laws forcing unpopular behavior on people succeeded.  Stop trying to save people from themselves.  </p>
<p>No, addiction will not rise or fall.  The only result will be that maybe we can use the money to fight REAL crime. Our prisons are filled with people whose lives will be ruined because of a few ounces of marijuana.  Maybe the penal system will lose some $$, but maybe there will be resources to contain real criminals, instead of releasing hardened criminals because the money ran out (i.e. California).</p>
<p>Stop the nonsense! We tax alcohol and tobacco; do the same for marijuana and use the money to help addition of all three substances.</p>

			<p>Mexico&#8217;s latest effort to control the drug trade is another example of an expensive and futile uphill battle. </p>
<p>The joint interdiction programs (U.S.-Mexico) will bolster the ranks of narcocrats (members of the various bureaucracies created to combat international drug trade), a powerful constituency, adding to the complexity of the problem. Therefore, while being great political tools, the billions spent will do little to stem the flow of illicit substances.</p>
<p>Mexico&#8217;s Supreme Court is currently reviewing the various amparos (legal injunctions) filed pursuant to the publication of the new drug norm mentioned in the story. The high court was evenly split (5-5) on one such review on Sept. 10.</p>
<p>Regardless of the ruling, as long as demand remains high in the U.S. and Canada, little will change when it comes to drug related violence.</p>

			<p>Casteneda&#8217;s remarks are the only ones that capture the<br />
meaning of the situation. Just one quibble: he says,&#8221;the risk of being arrested for possession has grown considerably with the new law, whereas before, the real risk was just a shake-down by the authorities.&#8221; True. But today the risk isn&#8217;t arrest and encarceration either. It&#8217;s just a bigger shakedown than before. This is because if there are arrests, the new law mandates some kind of bogus therapy program for addicts. Thus, authorities can now threaten people with being remanded for addiction therapy&#8211;where the eventual shakedowns will be several degrees higher than the original one.</p>

			<p>Just for the record,  and Mr. Nadelman is hardly the only person utilizing the language this way when he says &#8220;Americans generally prefer the higher quality marijuana grown in our own country&#8221; but may I remind him, and the Times, and National Geographic and&#8230;.. that Mexicans are Americans.

			<p>Calvina Fay is predictably idiotic. Her argument is that drug users are bad because they buy drugs coming from criminal organizations. By that argument, if tomatoes were illegal, tomato users would be  bad because they would be buying from criminal organizations. This example illustrates the idiocy of using circular reasoning to justify a nonsensical and failed policy.</p>

			<p>It is ironic, if not highly suspect, that little political efforts have been made to lay the foundations for a potential national (if not international) regulated market for what are now categorized as illegal drugs. If we trust the market to optimize decisions on matters as sensitive as healthcare, retirement and pharmaceutical innovation, should we not trust it to deal with the production, distribution and allocation of (illegal) drugs? The natural pioneers of this market – the pharmaceutical and tobacco industries – possess enough political capital, economic influence and institutional power to curb and even eliminate the existing drug cartels. In a sense, to bring illegal drugs into the light of open (though highly regulated) market exchange is the only solution for the current set of problems. </p>
<p>However small and potentially double-edged, Mexico’s new law may well constitute an additional step in illuminating the complexities and possibilities of dealing with drugs. Yet for those seeking realistic solutions, caution must be exercised: relatively small yet politically influential groups of moral entrepreneurs, whose voices and opinions are poor reflections of the ‘public interest, continue to monopolize the debate on the decriminalization and possible legalization of drugs. Drugs are too often cast as objects of moral deliberation rather than the subjects of evidence-based public policy. Unfortunately, public discussions are rife with broad and unsubstantiated generalizations and erroneous causal inferences (e.g. Fay’s allusion that drugs, rather than poverty and social marginalization, are the source of children in foster care). The fight against drugs is as much a fight against the rhetoric of fear mongering as it is against the material and institutional weapons of organized crime.</p>

			<p>At least Mexico is showing a glimmer of intelligence on the subject of drugs.  Now, how about the land of the free and the home of the brave? Or are freedom and reason just too scary?</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve smoked with everyone from the unemployed to college professors and police officers, career soldiers &#038; career students.  I have seen everyone between the ages of 8 &#038; 76 partake of something that is honestly a normal part of life on earth right now.  Attitudes like Mexico is displaying towards drugs will change in America in time&#8230;just give it time.</p>

			<p>Pot being so &#8220;bad&#8221; is one of those lies that all these Jedi masters in industry and politics want the public to believe. No one has ever killed themselves from a pot overdose,most car accidents are not pot related , most crime is not pot related, except perhaps gang turf crime. We need the tax revenue,every body smokes it. It&#8217;s like this big open secret. Enough already make it legal.</p>

			<p>The only reason why Mexico is in such a dire situation, is the price of recreational drugs in the USA. If you can bring the price down substantially, i.e. government control of production and/or distribution of cocaine/marihuana, the  corruption and murder will disappear (drug-related).</p>
<p>That is what Latin-America and the USA will WIN. No more drugs related murder and corruption. 100% sure.<br />
How are you going to deal with the (increase in) addicts?<br />
You can deal with the addicts, by creating a paradigm shift.</p>
<p>Instead of sending your military/police force. You retrain those guys into social workers (no job losses there, probably fewer costs). Improve their listening skills. Let them talk with the addicts and provide shelter. Let them work on farms for addicts so that they can produce their own food and feel useful and help give them a chance to return to society. </p>
<p>You have to ask yourself. Is it really the drugs that led to the downfall of the addicts? Were there not  initial problems which led to substance abuse? </p>
<p>You will never win this battle by fighting. We have to change our societies. You can look for faults in the individual but on this one you will have to look for major faults in our own societies.</p>
<p>Penalties against possesion of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself.<br />

			<p>The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the Prohibition law, for nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced.</p>
<p>&#8211;Albert Einstein, My First Impression of the U.S.A, 1921</p>
<p>Our current drug crisis is a tragedy born of a phony system of classification. For reasons that are little more than accidents of history, we have divided a group of nonfood substances into two categories: items purchasable for supposed pleasure (such as alcohol), and illicit drugs. The categories were once reversed. Opiates were legal in America before the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914,<br />
and members of the Women&#8217;s Christian Temperance Union, who campaigned against alcohol during the day, drank their valued &#8220;women&#8217;s tonics&#8221; at night, products laced with laudanum (tincture of opium).</p>
<p>I could abide&#8212;though I would still oppose&#8212;our current intransigence if we applied the principle of total interdiction to all harmful drugs. But how can we possibly defend our current policy based on a dichotomy that encourages us to view one class of substances as a preeminent scourge while the two most dangerous and life-destroying substances by far, alcohol and tobacco, form a second class advertised in neon on every street corner of urban America? And why, moreover, should heroin be viewed with horror while chemical cognates that are no different from heroin than lemonade is from iced tea perform work of enormous compassion by relieving the pain of terminal cancer patients in their last days?</p>

			<p>&#8220;Calvina Fay is executive director of Drug Free America Foundation Inc.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is one of our problems in a nutshell &#8211; no pun intended.  A drug free America???  What about the legal, deadly, and addictive drug alcohol, Calvina???  This is part of the whole problem &#8211; people don&#8217;t even recognize alcohol to be the HARD drug that it in fact is.  The social wreckage from pot pales in comparison to alcohol.  This crowd is in serious denial &#8211; Americans have always LOVED mind altering substances &#8211; mostly alcohol.  To criminalize people for using the far safer drug pot is the real crime here.</p>
<p>Mexico, with about ten thousands deaths this year alone in it&#8217;s raging drug war, needed to make a bold move.  This looks like the right one.  Only a blind fool(see above) would think that we will get rid of pot in America &#8211; our number one cash crop.  The lying fear mongers have dominated this debate for too long.  Reality is catching up with them quickly.  The real truth is that pot smokers stand on the high ground above the deadly drinkers(pun intended).  </p>
<p>The outrageous expenses now burdening states because of our misguided drug war have reached the breaking point.  The savings gained from changing laws along with increased revenue from taxing pot is win win for everybody.</p>

			<p>This is ALL wrong. The United States NEEDS to listen to the Majority and Legalize marijuana.  It is ARE demand for Pot that causes everything, I mean come on!!  Some of these so called &#8220;smart&#8221;  pope don&#8217;t seem to have a clue. And If the Majority of Americans want Marijuana Legalized why are we just talking about it anyway?

			<p>I, for one, am tired of seeing the failed policies of continued criminalizing of drug possession and use. I am totally in favor of treating drug addiction as we treat alcohol addiction &#8211; as a disease. Once that concept is accepted, we can devise methods of dealing with this disease and stop the failed approach of the past.</p>

			<p>it&#8217;s high time that the US should follow Mexico&#8217;s example.<br />
Personal use of pot is a choice every citizen should make for him or herself, just as the government does not interfere with use of tobacco and alcohol, as long as people don&#8217;t engage in illegal activities under the influence &#8211; e.g. drunk driving. And just think what we&#8217;d save on prison cost if we did not lock up people for smoking.</p>

			<p>Since it appears Obama is expanding the war in Afghanistan, and is failing in getting public health care for his citizens, and is allowing lobbyists in Washington to continue to run the show, the very least he could do is to change the marijuana laws in the US to something more sensible that reflects the reality of the widespread use of an innocuous drug.</p>

			<p>All of the essays above make a lot of sense, except for that of Ms. Fay.  When she speaks of drug users supporting the &#8220;vicious cartels&#8221; she reveals the basic flaw in her argument.  If drug (at the very least, marijuana) use is decriminalized, its production controlled and its sales taxed (as with alcohol and cigarettes) the cartels would find their influence and customer base greatly diminished.<br />
As one who has seen the behavior of Mexican police in resort areas towards tourists possessing miniscule amounts of drugs, I feel that this decision will also reduce police corruption on a local scale, especially if accompanied by an increase in salary to remove the incentive for bribery and shakedowns .</p>
