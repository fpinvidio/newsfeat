<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Is it just a fluke that South Carolina has another politician in trouble for behaving badly? </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Representative Joe Wilson, a Republican whose district includes Hilton Head, spent Thursday <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/us/politics/11Wilson.html">apologizing for yelling &#8220;you lie!&#8221; at Mr. Obama </a>during his health care address on Wednesday night.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Meanwhile, South Carolina&#8217;s governor, Mark Sanford, whose acknowledgment of an extramarital affair has opened up broader accusations of official misconduct, has been <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/10brfs-REPUBLICANSA_BRF.html">asked to resign by 61 of the 72 Republicans</a> in the state House of Representatives. Mr. Sanford is standing firm. &#8220;God can use imperfect people to perform His will,&#8221; he said on Tuesday.</p>

<h4>The Rebel Yell</h4>
<div class="w50 left"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs/roomfordebate/contributors/bob_moser.50.jpg" alt="Bob Moser" /></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><strong>Bob Moser,</strong> editor of The Texas Observer and contributing writer for The Nation, is the author of &#8220;Blue Dixie: Awakening the South&#8217;s Democratic Majority.&#8221; </em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I was talking with a New York friend right after the big health-care speech, and she asked: &#8220;Do you have any guesses about who yelled at Obama?&#8221; I think she had detected a Dixie yelp in the inflection of the voice that shattered Congressional decorum. </p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>In a Congressman&#8217;s bellow, echoes of John C. Calhoun,  Strom Thurmond &#8212; and a state&#8217;s racial politics.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The desperate, yodeling quality of that &#8220;You lie!&#8221; — it was as if some member of Congress had suddenly, involuntarily burst out with an abbreviated version of the oldest of white conservative Southern complaints: We will not stand for this imposition, this trampling of our God-given rights, this insult to our honor and our sovereignty! Which made me reply, &#8220;I&#8217;d place my bet on a South Carolinian.&#8221;  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There has always been something uniquely spiky about South Carolina&#8217;s politics, from the run-up to secession right through Gov. Mark Sanford (who once brought live pigs onto the state House floor to protest &#8220;pork&#8221; spending) and, now, the mouthy Rep. Joe Wilson. What distinguishes South Carolina&#8217;s politics is the fierceness with which ideologies are held sacred — and the deep undercurrents of race that still run through everything. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">While racial issues don&#8217;t infest the state&#8217;s politics in the blatant way that they once did, they still matter more in South Carolina than perhaps anywhere else in the South. The dominant Republican Party has managed to hold together its fundamentalist, anti-government and Chamber of Commerce factions largely because there&#8217;s some underlying — often unconscious — sympathy between them on issues of race. Meanwhile, Democrats are widely stereotyped in South Carolina as &#8220;the black party&#8221; — a label that hasn&#8217;t changed despite the Democratic leanings of the state&#8217;s fast-multiplying Latino population. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So it was no great surprise that Joe Wilson&#8217;s rebel yell was provoked by the first black president&#8217;s declaration that his health plans didn&#8217;t include government health care for illegal immigrants. It was an echo of the summer&#8217;s rowdy town halls all over America, for sure. But it was also an echo of those South Carolina statesmen, from John C. Calhoun to Strom Thurmond, who have forever specialized in one shouted word: &#8220;No!&#8221; </p>

<h4>Helping the Opposition</h4>
<div class="w50 left"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs/roomfordebate/contributors/jack_bass.50.jpg" alt="Jack Bass" /></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><strong>Jack Bass</strong>, a professor of Humanities and Social Sciences at the College of Charleston, is author of several books about the American South and co-author of &#8220;Strom: The Complicated Personal and Political Life of Strom Thurmond.&#8221;  </em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Joe Wilson apparently has become infected with the peculiarly South Carolina disease known as politicus apologia, for which Gov. Mark Sanford apparently became the first known victim.  The governor has gone statewide for weeks with personal displays of the symptoms, which range from a combination of feverish denials of wrongdoing to sweaty speeches of apology for other doings before civic clubs and through media outlets. </p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>Joe Wilson once denounced the claim of Essie Mae Washington-Williams as being a daughter of Strom Thurmond.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> Another symptom, as Mr. Wilson is already demonstrating, is a painful boost in fundraising for one&#8217;s already announced opponent, in this case former Marine captain and Iraqi war veteran Rob Miller.  By mid-afternoon, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced Mr. Miller had raised $400,000 since Joe Wilson shouted, &#8220;You lie.&#8221;  Mr. Miller&#8217;s almost 47 percent of the vote against Mr. Wilson&#8217;s in 2008 chopped 10 percentage points off the incumbent&#8217;s showing two years earlier.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Research continues on whether this infection in the state is limited to the South Carolina G.O.P.&#8217;s  DNA.  Earlier indicators of Mr. Wilson&#8217;s infection were displayed several years ago when he loudly denounced the claim of Essie Mae Washington-Williams as being a daughter of Strom Thurmond. Mr. Wilson called her story &#8220;unseemly&#8221; and a &#8220;smear.&#8221;  Her name today is listed on the State House monument to her father, alongside those of his white children.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It&#8217;s a great time to live in South Carolina.  Nobody&#8217;s bored.   </p>

<h4>An Honest Gut Reaction </h4>
<div class="w50 left"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs/roomfordebate/contributors/armstrong_williams.50.jpg" alt="Armstrong Williams" /></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><a href="//"><strong>Armstrong Williams </strong></a>can be heard nightly on Sirius/XM Power 169 from 9 pm to 10 pm.</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I’ve often heard the phrase growing up around the fields of South Carolina that if you don’t make dust, you eat dust. In many respects, that phrase personifies how my South Carolina brothers view themselves and the rapid way they jump on issues. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Passion supplants civility. Not too often, but when it does, it is often perceived as warranted. Some would liken it to a hair-trigger mentality, but it’s more a verbal gut reaction and their wide-eyed views of what’s right and what’s wrong with the world, as they see it. </p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>Joe Wilson will be regarded as a hero in some circles for calling out falsehoods of the Obama message machine. </p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In many respects, Joe Wilson’s outburst last night was more from the gut as it was from the heart. I know Joe Wilson. He’s a self-effacing, humble man, like many in his district. He’s not prone to such antics, which is why I was shocked to discover listening to the president’s speech that his was the voice that screamed those words. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Poor taste? You bet. But to many in the Palmetto State, Congressman Wilson’s lapse reflected weeks of pent up frustration from the thousands of constituents he and several of his colleagues heard at their own town halls. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He’ll be regarded as a hero in some circles; not for his disrespect, these are, after all, gentrified southerners. But rather, Joe Wilson will be viewed for doing the right thing  —  for calling out the falsehoods of the Obama message machine, there and then. No dawdling, no delay. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It may have taken Joe an errant syllable or two last night with his syrupy drawl, but he was going to make his point, all else be damned.</p>

<h4>The Curse of One-Party Domination</h4>
<div class="w50 left"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs/roomfordebate/contributors/lacy_ford.50.jpg" alt="Lacy Ford" /></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><strong>Lacy K. Ford Jr.</strong>is professor of history and chair of the department at the University of South Carolina. His most recent book, “Deliver Us From Evil: The Slavery Question in the Old South,” was published by Oxford University Press this month. </em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Many South Carolinians of both parties have suffered unexpected embarrassment from two of the state’s most prominent Republicans —  Governor Mark Sanford, who admitted an affair with an Argentinian woman, and Congressman Joe Wilson, who broke all the rules of Congressional decorum by shouting “you lie” at President Obama during his speech. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There is certainly no shortage of historical precedents for bold and outlandish, and even uncivil behavior by prominent South Carolina political figures. </p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>Safe political seats have encouraged the rise of boorish behavior and ideological rigidity.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Perhaps the most famous of such precedents occurred in 1856 when South Carolina Congressman Preston Brooks, a nationalist, entered the Senate chamber and caned Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner after the latter had given a speech attacking slavery and insulting South Carolina politicians. Sumner was temporarily disabled by the beating and missed many months of senate duty; Brooks resigned his seat but received a hero’s welcome in South Carolina for defending the honor of the state. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">During the 1890s, Ben Tillman, an avowed racist who worked to disfranchise all African Americans in the state, drew national attention by declaring that, if elected to the U.S. Senate, he would stick his pitchfork in the fleshy ribs of the rotund Grover Cleveland, who was of Tillman’s own party. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But as a historian, I would suggest that the explanations for South Carolina’s more recent round of bad political behavior lie as much in the nature of the state’s newly-crafted political culture of one-party domination as in its older lineage of provincial defiance. </p>
<div class="toggleContent">

<div class="hiddenContent" style="display: none;">
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In recent years, South Carolina has emerged as one of the reddest of the red states, meaning that in statewide races and in a healthy majority of congressional and legislative districts, Republican candidates cannot lose unless a significant number of loyal voters defect. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Democratic opposition is not a serious threat to most Republican candidates. The real competition Republicans face comes, if it comes at all, only in the Republican primary. Hence Republican candidates typically focus on trying to outdo each other in appealing to the state’s arch-conservative party base. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This process has pulled an already a very conservative Republican party even further to the right. The curse of safe seats has been the rise of boorish behavior and ideological rigidity. This trend has neither prepared Republicans well for governing nor, apparently, helped them remember how to engage in civil discourse with their opponents. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But Republicans confident of their power at home suddenly grew very testy when confronted with impotence on the national stage. As the elections of 2008 swept large Democratic majorities into the U.S.. House and Senate and elected a Democrat president, the ability of South Carolina Republicans to influence the national agenda dwindled. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The 2008 elections suggested that South Carolina’s bet on a Republican national majority as the key to its continued federal influence had been lost. As the Republicans retreated into their shrinking southern redoubt, frustration, anger, and in some instance, unspeakable ugliness (the Wilson outburst) emerged. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The case of the mercurial Governor Sanford is different. Never so much a Republican as a libertarian (and perhaps above all a narcissist), Governor Sanford had conducted himself for six and a half years as a man more determined to call attention to himself than to govern effectively.<br />
 Few would have predicted that an affair would be his undoing, but anyone who had studied his career should have known his quirky vanity and a propensity to think his way was the only way. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But even in this hour of Republicans behaving badly, the G.O.P. in South Carolina can claim Lindsay Graham, a independent-minded conservative who has worked across the aisle in the U.S. Senate on a number of occasions, and state attorney general Henry McMaster, who broke with Governor Sanford when the governor opposed the acceptance of the federal stimulus package.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Harvey Gantt, a Charleston native and the first African American to attend Clemson University, is reported to have noted in the 1960s that when you can’t appeal to South Carolinians’ morals, you can still appeal to their manners. Let’s hope, Joe Wilson and Mark Sanford aside, he may still be proven right. </p>

<h4>A Tradition of Resistance</h4>

</a></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Wednesday night’s bleating-heart outburst from Joe Wilson will surprise nobody familiar with the history of South Carolina politics. No state boasts a tradition of shrill resistance to the Republic comparable to South Carolina’s.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Thomas Jefferson removed condemnations of slavery from the Declaration of Independence to appease South Carolinian slaveholders. State loyalists helped the British recapture the state in 1780 from the patriots. By 1828, state icon and Vice President John C. Calhoun was advocating state “nullification” of federal powers.</p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>Mr. Wilson&#8217;s outburst was typical of politicians from a state that has resisted policy progress on most fronts.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> In 1860, South Carolina became the first state to secede — and even threatened to secede from the Confederacy because the other southern states refused to re-open the slave trade. In 1856, on the Senate floor Congressman Preston Brooks bloodied an abolitionist senator with a cane.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Well into the 20th century, South Carolina’s black citizens observed the Fourth of July mostly alone; the vast majority of whites preferred instead to celebrate Confederate Memorial Day. In 1920, the state legislature rejected the women’s suffrage amendment, finally ratifying it a half century later. </p>

Strom Thurmond was the States’ Rights Democratic Party presidential nominee. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Were it not for a facing-saving political intervention, the Clarendon County school district, not Topeka’s, would have been forever remembered as the defendant in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case. And when Congress passed the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the Palmetto State became the first to challenge its constitutionality in court.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Wilson&#8217;s outburst was typical of politicians from a state that have resisted policy progress in the United States whether for minorities, women, the disempowered or, now, the uninsured.</p>

			<p>WTH is wrong with Armstrong Williams? Wilson &#8220;called out the falsehoods of the Obama message&#8221;? Is Mr. Williams not aware that Obama&#8217;s proposal DOES NOT COVER ILLEGALS? Wilson is the liar, and I can&#8217;t believe I, lowly poster, need to point that out to a journalist! Or is Mr. Williams just another blathering talking head? </p>
<p>Media, when will you resume your watchdog role? Obama told the truth, Wilson told the lie. Why oh why is the issue about civility? It&#8217;s about Wilson either being completely clueless or intent on destroying the Obama presidency at all costs. </p>
<p>Oh, and PS, the President represents America. And Americans. Tearing down the President brings us all down.</p>

They are so jealous and bitter that President Obama is doing so good and working so hard for the middle and lower class unlike the GOP.

			<p>My theory is that this unknown Representative spouted off to get his name in the national spotlight and headlines in the papers back home. As the old saying goes, &#8220;All publicity is good publicity,&#8221; and hailing from a religious-right state currently plagued by an adulterous Governor, well, loudmouth Joe may just have been voicing interest in his next political career move.</p>
<p>In conservative South Carolina, how many electorate popularity points do you think &#8220;bravely standing up&#8221; and &#8220;calling out&#8221; the Demon-cratic Antichrist  is worth?</p>

			<p>Thank goodness someone has finally had courage to tell the truth about Obama to his face!  I&#8217;m fed up with Obama and his fellow lying Socialists whining about him being a &#8220;victim&#8221;, supposedly, pulling the &#8220;race&#8221; card every single opportunity they get!  I only wish he had not apologized to Obama for telling him exactly what most of us Americans would have told him ourselves, if only we had been given the same opportunity!    </p>
<p>Our opinion of Obama isn&#8217;t based upon race&#8211;it&#8217;s based purely upon Obama&#8217;s own voting record and based upon everything else that this Socialist Dictator and his regime have done against the will of the American people since our Presidentical elections were stolen, and he became America&#8217;s First President in history to refuse to show the full version of his Birth Certificate to those of us he claims are his &#8220;fellow Americans&#8221;!  Despite the fact Obama could have put an end to this controversy himself by doing just doing so, his refusal reveals this man has something he wants to hide from all of us! </p>
<p>This anger didn&#8217;t originate with the Republican Party like Obama and his cronies expect the uneducated to believe.  This anger comes from our &#8220;Silent Majority&#8221; who no longer intend to remain silent, anymore!</p>

			<p>Joe Wilson&#8217;s rude grandstanding was inexcusable and an unpardonable offense to the office of the presidency.  Because of it&#8230;I am ashamed to be living in the South&#8230;but&#8230;Proud that I severed my relationship with the Republican Party shortly before the last election..</p>

			<p>Lindsay Graham has a reputation for being reasonable and moderate.  Why has he not been more vocal in his denouncement of Wilson&#8217;s conduct?  The country needs to quickly rediscover civility.  We are careening out of control.  John&#8217;s McCain&#8217;s quick and definitive denouncement was a good first step.</p>

			<p>Yes, South Carolina is, historically, different.  South Carolina&#8217;s intransigence directly resulted in the showdown at Fort Sumter, which in turn ushered in the national catastrophe called the Civil War and ended with the South being pounded into the ground.  If the good ol&#8217; boys of South Carolina are going to start quoting Scripture, they might recall that &#8220;Pride goeth before a fall.&#8221;  The pride of the Southern cracker is truly pathetic.  It&#8217;s all they have left.</p>

			<p>Wilson (and Sanford and DeMint) should try to bear in mind the famous observation that S. Carolina is too large to be an insane asylum.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#8217;t bring them around, how about the words &#8220;travel boycott&#8221;?</p>

			<p>What Obama is not telling you is that illegals don’t need to be covered by an Obama plan&#8230;they receive free and unlimited healthcare under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act.</p>
<p><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Treatment_and_Active_Labor_Act" rel="nofollow">//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Treatment_and_Active_Labor_Act</a></p>
<p>The patients crowding delivery rooms in many of this country’s largest hospitals (including Parkland Memorial, the 2nd busiest) are 70% illegal immigrants dropping anchor babies&#8230; subsidized by financially strapped hospitals and the US taxpayer.  </p>
<p><a href="//www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/061206dnmetmoms.d9b9669.html" rel="nofollow">//www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/061206dnmetmoms.d9b9669.html</a></p>
<p>The same is true of many other non-emergency treatments such as renal dialysis (and multiple kidney transplants) which continue indefinitely, at a cost which easily reaches $1,000,000+ per illegal.</p>
<p><a href="//seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2008369322_immigdialysis09.html" rel="nofollow">//seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2008369322_immigdialysis09.html</a>  </p>
<p>Hospitals are never compensated for most of services that they are forced to provide to illegals under the law, while US citizens who subsidize the illegals’ free healthcare are forced to wait behind them in long lines for the exact same services. </p>
<p>This is an outrage&#8230; and nothing in Obama’s “reform” does a thing about it.</p>

			<p>c in Tx,</p>
<p>Excellent point.</p>
<p>If Wilson is wrong, THAT should be the story, rather than incivility.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t dishonesty trump &#8220;incivility&#8221; in a national legislator? I hope so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, wouldn&#8217;t it have been nice if Wilson had stood up and yelled &#8220;You lie&#8221; whenever Bush, Cheney or Powell told Congress that Iraq had WMDs. And if he had in that case, Wilson would have been the one telling the truth.</p>

			<p>Our Congressional Research Service (CRS) previously reports illegal aliens will be covered under HR3200. This CRS is a government agency which performs research for Congress. CRS is a highly credible source.</p>
<p>Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) also reports the same; illegal aliens are covered by HR3200.</p>
<p>Two credible sources there, both contradicting Obama. Rather clear Obama did and is lying to America, as are most left liberals.</p>

			<p>I would say that I am surprised in Wilson&#8217;s behavior, but I am not.  I live in SC and have noticed increased agitation and disapproval of the President among conservatives in the area.  They know exactly what they are doing. They are not idiots or people of low intelligence.  They are lying, manipulating, and gaming their constituents who are idiots, gullible and some who just need any excuse to hate.  Their agenda is not their love for  American people or their country.  Their agenda is their love for power and supremacy.  Sarah Palin may not know the details of the issues, but she does know that there are those whom she can manipulate with lies and hate.  Wilson is cut from the same cloth.  He wanted to show his constituents that a Black man may be the President, but he doesn&#8217;t have to respect him.  </p>
<p>I appeal to any of you out there who thinks that this was a display of freedom of speech from a man who loves his country, to really look at the the love the Republican party has shown the American people for the last 8.5 years.<br />
They have loved us so much, we have been used to fight and die for an unnecessary war.  They have loved us so much, they wrecked the economy and sent our deficits through the roof.  They have loved us so much, they raped and plundered us with high gas prices to line their own pockets.  They loved us so much, they kept us in constant fear of terrorist attacks for their own political gain.  </p>
<p>You get the picture.  They really love us.  That&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t want us to have a level playing field to drive down the cost of healthcare.  If you&#8217;re so gullible, for once you may need to question the quality of the love you are willing to receive.  It&#8217;s all in the action baby, not the passionate, heated words. </p>
<p>By the way, we&#8217;re paying for immigrants to get healthcare now.  Why not give it to them upfront and let them pay a fee?  Also, corporations increase their shareholder profits by making cuts all the time.  It is believable to me that their is enough waste in healthcare to provide savings to help pay for healthcare.  When the taxes on the wealthiest Americans go back to where they were under Clinton, the rest of the money will be there?  Clinton balanced the budget in eight years.  Healthcare needs 10 years to pay for itself.  Stop fighting stimulus and jobs under the disguise of love for the country and concern for your constituents.  Wilson&#8230;..&#8221;You lie&#8221;.</p>

			<p>Mr. Wilson gets all worked up over illegal aliens yet his party has endorsed and promoted the wholesale export and outsourcing of American jobs. Whatever happened to all those textile mills in South and North Carolina? </p>
<p>I have never contributed to a politician that would not directly affect me, but in this case I did make a donation to Mr. Miller&#8217;s campaign, and if it looks like he will need more money, I will do it again. I have lost all patience with Mr. Wilson&#8217;s ilk.</p>

			<p>Isn&#8217;t Joe Wilson an hoot and a half? It truly is an amusing thing to behold. The extreme right wing is having a collective, massive nervous breakdown. They just can&#8217;t come to terms with the nasty little fact that a black guy is the most powerful human being on the planet. It really is kind of funny &#8211; to a point.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening, boys and girls: The so-called &#8220;party of Lincoln&#8221; has been forever exposed as ideologically bankrupt and they are in the process of implementing their &#8220;scorched earth policy&#8221;. In other words, if they have to go down (and down they are going) they&#8217;re going to bring the rest of the country down with them. That is what is happening. If you think the right wing has lost its collected marbles, as Al Jolson used to say, &#8220;You ain&#8217;t seen nothin&#8217; yet&#8221;. There is violence down the road. Count on it. </p>
<p>Sound paranoid? Stay tuned.</p>
