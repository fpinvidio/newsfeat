<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It&#8217;s official: your suspicions of Wall Street greed have been confirmed. Despite last year&#8217;s huge losses, multibillion-dollar bailouts and closings of some of the biggest names in the industry, Wall Street still gave out <a href="//www.nytimes.com/2009/01/29/business/29bonus.html">an estimated $18.4 billion in bonuses</a>. Indeed,<a href="//www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/jan09/012809.htm"> last year&#8217;s bonuses</a> were the <a href="//dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/wall-street-bonuses-fell-44-in-2008-report-says/">sixth-largest on record</a>. </p>

<h4>The End of an Era</h4>
<div class="w50 left"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs/roomfordebate/contributors/john_coffee.50.jpg" alt="John Coffee"></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><strong><a name="coffee">John C. Coffee Jr.</a></strong> is the Adolf A. Berle Professor of Law and director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia University Law School.</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Although the public is amazed at the seeming arrogance underlying Merrill Lynch’s payment of more than $4 billion in discretionary bonuses to its investment bankers in a year in which it incurred record losses, this episode may more truly mark the “last hurrah” for a system and a culture that is approaching extinction. </p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>&#8220;Investment banks were teams of prima donnas, compensated under an &#8216;eat-what-you-kill&#8217; system.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Free-standing investment banks were the historical product of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which insisted on the separation of investment and commercial banking. With the repeal of that legislation in 1999, larger commercial banks gradually began to acquire investment banks, and the 2008 financial crisis simply accelerated this process. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As this happened, two very different cultures collided &#8212; and Bank of America’s evident anger at the Merrill Lynch bonuses shows this culture shock. Commercial banks tend to be bureaucratic and hierarchical institutions with large executive staffs, in which junior officers climb the executive ladder patiently. </p>
<div class="w190 left"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs/roomfordebate/wall_street.190h.jpg" alt="Wall Street"><span class="caption">(Photo: Mary Altaffer/Associated Press)</span></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Investment banks were teams of prima donnas, compensated under an “eat-what-you-kill” system. Investment bankers were also highly mobile, and even mid-level bankers might be the key “relationship” partners to major clients, who could take the clients with them if they moved. Hence, they could command a portion of the transaction revenues that they generated.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The federal bailout is compelling the end of this compensation system  because the bonuses would come from taxpayer subsidies. But the incompatibility of the two cultures would likely have curtailed them anyway.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Does this mean that the day of the entrepreneurial risk-taking professional, who accepts feast and famine in alternating years, is over? Not really. Other professions seem also to thrive on “eat-what-you-kill” compensation. Witness the plaintiff’s attorney paid by contingency fees and the professional athlete with performance bonuses. But such a compensation system proves organizationally disruptive within larger and more staid &#8220;corporatist&#8221; organizations &#8212; except possibly at the very top!</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Bonuses v. Bailout</h4>
<div class="w50 left"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs/roomfordebate/contributors/lori_kletzer.50.jpg" alt="Lori Kletzer"></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><strong><a name="kletzer">Lori Kletzer</a></strong> is a professor of labor economics at University of California, Santa Cruz.</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The point of employee bonuses is to tie compensation to results. If employees do better when the firm does better, then individual efforts and interests may be more correctly aligned with firm interests. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Hence, workers get bonuses in good times, and get their &#8220;guaranteed&#8221; salary in bad times. For Wall Street firms, 2008 was clearly a &#8220;terrible, horrible, no good, very bad&#8221; year (with apologies to Judith Viorst&#8217;s Alexander). Surely, there was no &#8220;performance&#8221; reason for Wall Street to dole out $18.4 billion in bonuses.</p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>&#8220;Firms taking bailout money should be subject to full public scrutiny in their compensation schemes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Worse, those bonuses came for a year when financial firms took government bailout money. In the sense that &#8220;all dollars are green,&#8221; it not only looks wrong, it<em> is </em>wrong for taxpayer money (including future generations, given the bailout/deficit link) to go to bonuses of the already affluent. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Yes, we know that some bonuses dribble down to administrative assistants and clerical staff. But shouldn&#8217;t these workers get appropriately sized guaranteed salaries without depending on bonuses? After all, it&#8217;s unlikely that their particular efforts drove firm profits. At the same time, these workers surely were not responsible for the financial crisis. So what can be done?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner noted the inappropriateness of Citigroup buying a $50 million corporate jet. Likewise, firms taking bailout money should be subject to full public scrutiny in their compensation schemes. The problem is not the bonus payments per se, it is the bailout money.</p>
<hr/>
<h4> Something&#8217;s Fishy</h4>
<div class="w50 left"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs/roomfordebate/contributors/susan_reed.50.jpg" alt="Susan E. Reed"></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><strong><a name="reed">Susan E. Reed</a></strong> is a journalist who has covered business news for CBS and several other organizations for 20 years.</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Merrill Lynch shareholders have begun to discuss the possibility of suing the company for reportedly paying out $3 to $4 billion in cash bonuses to the financial wizards who enabled the firm to lose billions last year.  A successful suit of this kind would give financial services companies the shove they need to reform bonus practices that sanctify infernal risk and focus too little on the long-term growth and stability of the company. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">A more productive way to distribute rewards is by only awarding company stock.  This would keep employees mindful of the risks they are taking to their organization and would tie their company’s performance to their own.  It would reduce the every-man-for-himself mentality that has thrived inside the big investment houses. And it would require employees and managers to shoulder their own risk.</p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>&#8220;A more productive way to distribute rewards is by only awarding company stock.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It is not at all clear at this point how the Merrill shareholders will proceed now that they have sold or traded their shares as part of the merger with Bank of America.  But the fact that Andrew Cuomo, New York’s attorney general, has started to subpoena the main players in the case indicates that he is at least suspicious of why the bonuses were paid in the first place, and issued in December, conveniently before the Bank of America’s acquisition in January.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The larger question for taxpayers, who, through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, will contribute an estimated $7,000 per family to some of the very financial companies that caused the meltdown, is why the risk the companies took will be socialized, spread to all taxpayers, while the gains will remain privatized.  This means, essentially, that each American family will pay at least $7,000 in bonuses to these companies for the destabilizing risks that undermined the global economy.  It begins to put bonuses in an entirely new light, doesn’t it?</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Money Isn&#8217;t Everything</h4>
<div class="w50 left"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs/roomfordebate/contributors/curt_coffman.50.jpg" alt="Curt W. Coffman"></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><strong><a name="coffman">Curt W. Coffman</a></strong>, a senior partner of a management consulting firm, is the co-author of “First, Break All the Rules” and “Follow This Path.”</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Many corporate directors and compensation committee members say they will lose great people and talent if bonuses are not provided. But this isn’t true.  Research shows that while pay and compensation are important, intrinsic motivation such as mission, purpose, achievement and creation of value trumps the dollar.  Indeed, when order of importance is tabulated, pay hovers at seventh place in its importance to creating high performance among employees. </p>
<div class="w190 right module">
<div class="entry">
<blockquote>&#8220;Corporate leaders who received a bonus in 2008 should do the right thing and return it to the company.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We don’t need to reform how we pay and reward employees, we simply need to return to the basic principles of performance-based compensation.  During the past decade or so, the criteria for bonuses on Wall Street has moved away from the company’s actual worth, or revenue, to posted gains instead. Those gains are often based on risky investments and offer only short-term insight into a company’s worth. </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Going forward, corporate directors need to tie compensation to clearly defined targets that build the value of the company’s shares to the benefit of employees, shareholders and long-term sustainability.  Why? Because organizations need to eschew “buying growth” and dedicate themselves instead to “building growth.” </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In the meantime, corporate leaders who received a bonus in 2008 should do the right thing and return it to the company. And at the end of the day, if you must pay employees the unearned bonus &#8212; do so and quickly show them the door!</p>
<hr/>
<h4>The Wrong Word</h4>
<div class="w50 left"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs/roomfordebate/contributors/james_othmer.50.jpg" alt="James P. Othmer"></div>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><em><strong><a name="othmer">James P. Othmer</a></strong> is the author of  “The Futurist,” a novel, and the forthcoming “Adland: Searching for the Meaning of Life on a Branded Planet.”</em></p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The problem isn’t with corporate bonuses; it’s with corporate semantics.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">By definition, a bonus is “something in addition to what is expected or strictly due.”  Perhaps, pre-Enron, pre-Madoff, pre-collapse of the financial, real estate and automotive industries, executives got away with receiving their annual seven figure bonuses because we were willing to believe that they truly were surprised by them.  Or we were so comfortable with our own financial situation that we didn’t care.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">After all, it was a bonus!  Super-sized versions of the token gestures we were occasionally given even in our own jobs. The holiday turkey.  The extra week’s paycheck.  Or, if you happened to work in my field of advertising during the 1990s, the window pane envelope filled with soon to be worthless stock options.  </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The primary reason we could call them bonuses is because some years we got one, but for so many others we got an explanation.  A key account was lost.  The global network had an off year. Something to do with the price of something.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Any true bonus has the thrill of uncertainty about it.  And the knowledge that when you finally get a good one all of your vocational stars are in alignment.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">However, when a bonus is not only expected but mandated under any circumstance, it ceases to be a bonus.   It becomes an outrage.  Same goes for perks.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">All of which is why I’m convinced if the Wall Street executives who this year raked in the sixth-highest haul in the history of bonuses, despite being responsible for the worst performing market of our lifetime, simply had the foresight to call their windfall anything but a bonus, we’d be cool with them.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We don’t need to reform corporate bonuses.  We just need to rephrase them.  Too bad bailout is taken.</p>

			<p>Mr. Obama did not spare the company in his remarks on Thursday, although he did not mention Citi by name. “Secretary Geithner already had to pull back on one institution that had gone forward with a multimillion-dollar plane it purchased at the same time as they are receiving TARP money,” he said, using the acronym for the government’s $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program, intended to rescue shaky financial firms. “We shouldn’t have to do that, because they should know better.”</p>
<p>Well&#8230; they don&#8217;t know better. for the first time, as an Obama supporter and a contributor, I beg them to make this all VERY clear and punish the greedy. Again, GREED. It sickens me that the money sent to rescue the economy had no stipulations.<br />
That &#8220;they should have known better&#8221; is not a term to explain what has happened. I welcome the government controls. PLEASE make this clear, or make it clear that money can be rescinded and prosecutions will follow for those who do not follow the spirit of the law.<br />

			<p>Since I have already contributed to the wealth that Bank of America has used to pay a premium price for a company eager to give away 5 billion dollars, I think that it is perfectly reasonable to stop paying said bank the money I owe them. The paltry 20 K of their money that I am using to survive wouldn&#8217;t pay for half of Thrain&#8217;s commode. I&#8217;m sure he wouldn&#8217;t mind sharing the wealth. What do you think? Would a wave of voluntary non-payment get their attention?</p>

			<p>With respect, where&#8217;s the &#8220;debate&#8221;?</p>
<p>Every opinion you&#8217;ve highlighted is anti-bonus.</p>
<p>Take an example:</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch has some 60,000 employees spread across hundreds of profit centers (I will assume that people understand the profit center concept).</p>
<p>Not all, or even most, of Merrill&#8217;s profit centers lost money in 2008. Lots of rank-and-file bankers worked very hard and produced profits for the company.</p>
<p>All of your &#8220;experts&#8221; want to say that, because a few Merrill employees made horrendously bad deals/trades (most of them several years ago), NO ONE at Merrill should get a bonus. </p>
<p>It is a well-settled management principle that people should not be held responsible for matters over which they have no authority. The vast majority of those 60,000 bankers have NO authority over anything other than their own (and their profit center&#8217;s) performance.</p>
<p>The other problem with your &#8220;experts'&#8221; analysis is that ignores (surely they know it) that a &#8220;bonus&#8221; on Wall Street&#8217;s compensation culture is NOT completely discretionary. </p>
<p>Young graduates are hired at base salaries which in no way support life in New York City. They sign on because they are promised an annual &#8220;bonus&#8221;. </p>
<p>The amount of the bonus can vary based on individual and profit center performance but the implicit (and often explicit) promise made is that, at the end of the year, a living wage will be paid to compensate for working 18 hour days, six days a week.</p>
<p>Finally, the NY Times reported that 2008 &#8220;bonus&#8221; payments are off 44%. The practical FACT of that number is that bankers took a BIG pay cut in 2008. For the typical investment banker a 44% cut in year end payment is NOT trivial.</p>

			<p>The truth is for many of us we don&#8217;t think we have much choice in how our money is &#8216;kept&#8217; and we do what we can with what we have and tolerate what we feel we have no control over. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m just waiting for someone to look into how Student Loan companies, like Sallie Mae, have handled our dollars and the tax dollars that subsidized our loans.  There are lengthy blogs about what these student loan companies have done to consumers and given my experience with Sallie Mae, clearly they should be at the top of the list of trees we are shaking and how our tax dollars are spent, and what consumer protections are in place. </p>
<p>The banking industry, we all knew about, the difference is now we have someone in office who cares about the corruption and what its doing to our economy.  </p>
<p>The truth is anyone can do anything, but most of the time people forget that all things connect to one another and there are consequences to every decision made.  What I see is that many people make choices based on short term gains and long term losses.  </p>
<p>We all share the same country, I think we need to learn to act like we do.</p>

			<p>Tying bonuses to sustainable long-term growth is an absolute must. </p>
<p>Anyone who took a bonus based on work related to toxic assets should be required to return the $$, or face dismissal. These employees did not produce anything of value for their firms, and should not be rewarded for their dismal performances.</p>
<p>The argument that bonuses are required to attract and retain talent is outmoded and lacks credibility in the world we know now . Both Titans and Pip-squeaks of Wall Street are grateful to have any job at all. No need to &#8220;incentivize.&#8221; (What an awful word.)</p>

			<p>Meanwhile, my mother&#8217;s &#8220;low-risk&#8221; retirement fund (she is a retired NYC schoolteacher who practically broke her back teaching the city&#8217;s children) is down 50% and probably never to return.</p>
<p>Where is her bonus?</p>
<p>All of those bankers should be strung up in a public place.</p>

			<p>I can only think about Cisco&#8217;s CEO who in 2001 declared that he will take a salary of $1 until he brought Cisco out of the dotcom bust.  He deftly and responsibly did exactly that.<br />
 Cisco continued to take good care of its employees as well. In the end Mr Chambers made good money from his stock options which was well deserved after all he more than anybody else was responsible for that rise in Cisco&#8217;s stock price. </p>
<p>  Mr Thain, the auto execs and the greedy Wall St. Investment bankers need to learn a lesson or two from Mr Chambers.</p>

			<p>The solution seem simple for jerks getting bonuses.  Lets institute a tax on bonuses of 125% when companies break even or loose money.  This way, the lucky receiptent, will have to pay big money to get the bonus.</p>
<p>In fact, lets institute it now for the 2008 tax year.  The treasury sure could use the money.</p>

			<p>These incompetent crooks not only pay themselves big bonuses, they have the nerve to appear on CNBC and say that the current stimulus bill is more of the same entitlement programs extended. These financial channels are nothing but the voice of the corporate scums. Hardworking folks have seen their 401 K drop by 50% and more. While most middleclass families and the poor have been living through these hardships since 2006, one morning in November 2008, this morning show host on CNBC says  &#8211; How did it come to this state?. Clearly the financial reporters are having fun time galavanting around the world in the corporate jets, and are more of secretaries  than Journalists. Shame on CNBC and their ilk.</p>

			<p>One doesn&#8217;t earn a bonus in a year where the American Taxpayer has to bailout your poorly run company. Nor did the shareholders deserve a dividend in a year where the American Taxpayer has to bailout your poorly run company.</p>
<p>The  American Taxpayer should get their money back. Hank Paulson, the 3-page memo guy, should land in jail. Chris Cox, I didn&#8217;t have enough staff and didn&#8217;t make a compelling case to Congress to get more&#8211;even when controlled by the Republicans who appointed me, should land in jail. The division of AIG which did the CDSs should land in jail.</p>

			<p>I thought this was a &#8220;room for debate&#8221; column.  Won&#8217;t anyone take the side of the poor bonus recipients??</p>
<p>As for these angry workers who will walk if they don&#8217;t get their bonuses, where will they walk to?  What other industry pays these salaries&#8211;not to mention bonuses?  Will they leave the US to work somewhere else where taxes are higher (England), they don&#8217;t speak the language (Tokyo), and the culture won&#8217;t tolerate the disparity of wages we seem to for granted (Seoul)?</p>

			<p>Wall Street, Wall Street, Wall Street.  Why is everyone so fixated on Wall Street?  Do you REALLY think that they hold the monopoly on greed and stupidity?  The average CEO now receives more compensation in ONE year (based primarily on the achievement of short term objectives) than the average worker would receive in TEN working LIFETIMES.  THAT is the root cause of the rot that is eating our economy.  These people stand to make so much money THIS YEAR that they don&#8217;t care what damage is done to the firm in the medium to long term.  This is NOT capitalism &#8211; this is uncontrolled greed.  In Sweden, the average CEO compensation is FOUR times the average worker&#8217;s compensation, not four hundred times.  Yet they don&#8217;t appear to have a problem hiring and holding top talent &#8211; the reason that boards and compensation committees regularly trot out for paying their paymasters absurd sums of money.</p>

			<p>The problem with attacking Wall Street bonuses is that Wall Street is not a monolith: not every employee, or even every investment banking executive, was losing money in credit default swaps and shoddy mortgage-backed securities.  If you&#8217;re an associate who worked your tail off taking a company public and made everyone &#8211; the company and your bank &#8211; a lot of money, why should you not get your bonus just because someone else lost money elsewhere?  This is the same logic that sees companies sell profitable units to finance money losers.  It doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>

			<p>How difficult would it have been in the Paulson/Bernanke/Bush plan to build safeguards in such as &#8220;no bank that gives bonuses this year gets a penny of this money. . . .&#8221;<br />
Or has I heard Robert Reich suggest  the other day on NPR: &#8220;no bank that gets TARP money gets to lobby Congress for x number of years. . . .&#8221;  </p>
<p>Oops, I keep forgetting:  as long as you have any Republican in office, you will have billions of dollars in handouts to their billionaire friends and tough luck for the rest of us!  The GOP motto: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got mine and screw the rest of you!&#8221;</p>

			<p>I am not surprised that banking and investment executives continue to give themselves bonuses even during this economic recession that we are having in this country.  They will go and lay off their workers and still continue to accept bonuses.  I think it is wrong; they feel they are better than most of their employees and the American consumers.  Any company that accepts taxpayer bailout funds and then gives their executives bonsus; the Federal Government should demand the companies return the bailout money at once.  They also need to cut out executive retreats, company planes and cars, executive formal lunches and dinners.  They need to learn to live like most of the working people in this country.</p>

			<p>Funniest thing is that I am not amazed at these guys. What was expected but that the TARP would be regarded as free money. I&#8217;m amazed that I have not seen one damn decent riot about it. Especially now that the economy is in the tank, too. I&#8217;ve made my share of mistakes in life. Seems to me I paid for them. Sorry, it just looks that way to me. These guys make mistakes and we pay for them. Yes, something needed to be done. But now we need to start looking for revenge. It&#8217;s a simple concept. An eye for a jet? A limb for a portfolio. Can we get Biblical on their useless arses? Can I get an amen? </p>
<p>Probably not. We have developed an weak social gag reflex. We swallow too damn much now. We are now become part of the problem.</p>
